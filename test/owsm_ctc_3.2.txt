5 utt 39.86 41.69 -0.8362  Woo! Woo!
6 utt 42.35 48.11 -0.0689  Two months ago, I was going to put the chickens up like I do every night, and they all come
7 utt 48.11 54.53 -0.3560  running and following me, and she was just down, and she wouldn't get up. And I thought,
8 utt 54.53 60.87 -0.2538  well, that's weird. And so I went over and just gently walked over to her and said,
9 utt 60.87 66.08 -0.5780  can you get up? And she just looked at me and did that. And she couldn't get up. And I tried,
10 utt 66.08 69.53 -0.1720  picked her up, and I just tried to set her down gently, and she just collapsed.
11 utt 70.04 77.72 -0.6540  And so evidently, she injured her tendon or a muscle, a pool of muscle. I'm not sure what she did,
12 utt 77.72 84.46 -0.6562  but I brought her in the house, and she stayed in Tommy's office for a couple of days, and I fed her,
13 utt 84.46 93.53 -0.7326  you know, oatmeal. And there's a, I take this stuff called zeal, and it's got turmeric in it, and
14 utt 94.83 102.03 -0.5453  you know, ashwagandha. It's got all these wonderful herbs and stuff in it, and foods.
15 utt 102.03 106.77 -0.5970  And so I thought, well, it's good for me. It helps my inflammation, so I give it to the chicken. So I
16 utt 107.27 114.63 -0.2005  started giving her the zeal in little syringes two or three times a day. And she started getting better,
17 utt 114.63 123.46 -0.4558  and a lot of TLC. And the next thing you know, well, hey, that's Dixie. You know Dixie.
18 utt 125.01 130.68 -0.2860  But the next thing you know, the, she was, she was walking better, even though she was kind of like
19 utt 130.68 134.77 -0.9048  hop-along. I called her a hop-along Cassidy kid, because she still kind of hop along, but she was
20 utt 134.77 139.35 -0.1408  doing just fine. And then a couple days ago, she was down again. I went to put them up in the chicken
21 utt 139.35 148.26 -0.2844  coop, and she was sitting down right there at the edge of the coop. Before I went vegan,
22 utt 148.92 154.03 -0.3793  I loved Chick-fil-A sandwiches, you know, chicken sandwiches. I mean, as much as anybody. And
23 utt 154.54 161.10 -0.1947  I would come home and with a sandwich, a chicken sandwich, and I'd have my chickens at my feet. And
24 utt 162.48 172.65 -0.2341  not everybody gets the tactile, you know, experience of living on a ranch like this going vegan. You know,
25 utt 174.44 182.12 -0.0671  I started having all these conflicts in my mind and my soul that I would be eating a chicken and
26 utt 182.12 186.94 -0.4440  loving this one, you know. And we never ate our own animals. Even the cows, we never slaughtered our own
27 utt 186.94 191.51 -0.3821  cows. We always bought the pretty pink packages, you know, at the grocery store.
28 utt 193.54 202.10 -0.1689  And she's going to sleep. And I remember vividly when I was working on her leg in the kitchen and
29 utt 202.10 210.61 -0.1986  giving her a little syringe of that, that zeal. I remember vividly that I was working on her and I
30 utt 210.71 217.27 -0.2459  got the gut feeling of how I used to eat chicken legs when I was working on her leg. And I just started
31 utt 217.27 227.54 -0.3847  crying at the sink. Just started crying. I mean, I was deep, guttural, horrifying, just sobs. Because I was
32 utt 227.54 235.24 -0.5267  working on her leg and realizing that, you know, everybody eats them. Never even thinks a thing about it.
33 utt 235.99 244.87 -3.9254  I was working on her leg. I was working on her leg. And I was working on her leg. And I was tired.
34 utt 244.87 250.81 -0.3417  And he goes, Hey, come out here. There's this girl that wants to meet you. And I said, Yeah, you're lying.
35 utt 251.07 260.28 -0.4201  You always are. And he was. And I went anyway. And anyway, I met her. Yeah, Renee's an incredible person.
36 utt 260.28 270.07 -0.4093  She's always done incredible stuff. One of the early things I saw was she was in a play in Houston,
37 utt 270.07 277.13 -0.9985  two or 3000 people, you know, threw the roses on the stage and all that stuff because she was the main
38 utt 277.13 284.84 -0.2725  singer. And she was right on the edge of making it. And it was a wild ride. You could write a book about
39 utt 284.84 298.32 -0.4019  her music career. And for whatever reason, it never happened. Oh, Shenandoah, I long to see you.
40 utt 307.01 312.84 -0.4253  Oh, Shenandoah, I long to see you.
41 utt 314.15 320.79 -0.1237  Across the wild Missouri.
42 utt 323.62 329.37 -0.1759  Herman's very soothed about music. And so I sing to him all the time.
43 utt 330.60 339.65 -0.1949  And I see his eyes change when I sing to him and I watch his ears perk up. I watch the hair go down on
44 utt 339.65 350.16 -0.4003  his back. You know, he he was on a concrete floor at that kill shelter. It was not nice.
45 utt 350.16 357.46 -0.1060  He had barking dogs all around him. And so he was very stressed when we got him.
46 utt 358.36 359.55 -0.1729  Very.
47 utt 360.85 365.16 -0.3263  Right over there, we're building his fences and his home.
48 utt 365.19 369.10 -0.1331  His little feet are going to touch the earth for the first time in a long time.
49 utt 369.60 372.55 -0.1965  Got to get him out of here. I want him out of here so bad.
50 utt 374.73 380.33 -0.0275  Herman's owner had passed away. He had been left for six months. The kids came and cleared out the
51 utt 380.33 384.90 -0.4053  house, cleared out the furniture, got the dog in the cap and left the pig. And Herman had been fending
52 utt 384.90 389.72 -0.1089  for himself. So the animal control officers had picked him up, brought him into the shelter.
53 utt 389.72 396.62 -0.5768  And Renee, God love her, she's a week out from this event. She has spent all the money she's got
54 utt 396.62 402.00 -0.0240  on this project. Her husband, at the time we talked on the phone, her husband was out in the midday sun
55 utt 402.18 410.58 -0.0623  mowing and shoring up fences to contain the bull calves that didn't go to slaughter. And she said,
56 utt 410.58 415.96 -0.5443  I don't know, Sleese, I don't know if I can, a pig. I've never dealt with a pig. I don't even have a place
57 utt 415.96 424.39 -0.1067  to put him. I don't know. When that big storm came through, everybody lost fence. Lots of Lake Jackson,
58 utt 424.39 431.93 -0.1110  lots of Danbury. So we got tons of calls and then she called me with this. I couldn't tell her no.
59 utt 432.11 438.35 -0.3450  And I think we exchanged 40 or maybe 50,000 emails about how we were going to get this done. And who
60 utt 438.35 441.24 -0.4770  was going to hold him, who was going to pick him up, what were we going to feed him, how are we going
61 utt 441.24 445.09 -0.7816  to lure him, who was going to house him, how are we going to get his pen built, how are we going to raise
62 utt 445.09 451.91 -0.4603  the money to build the pen. And it was just like this beehive of activity. And I came to have this
63 utt 451.91 456.89 -0.2502  enormous respect for Renee because she really is a, she would just get it done.
64 utt 457.07 462.66 -0.1281  The way I look at it is comes around, goes around. You do something good,
65 utt 463.41 468.44 -0.6790  somebody returns the favor eventually. So I always try to help out.
66 utt 471.43 479.52 -0.1171  Renee does the same. When she started talking about sanctuary, I didn't tell her, but
67 utt 480.02 488.42 -0.1922  I was thinking, I guess I'm going to get a divorce because this is ridiculous. It's not going to work
68 utt 488.42 501.74 -0.4639  in Texas. And she wanted to try it. And Renee is a very strong willed person. And you can't tell her
69 utt 501.74 507.68 -0.1613  not to do something. I wasn't trying to, you know, open up a sanctuary in the state of Texas. That's not
70 utt 507.68 513.22 -0.3881  been my goal in life. My goal was to be a famous country and western singer. Hello. That's what I
71 utt 513.22 518.84 -0.3357  thought I was going to be one day, you know, and, and that didn't happen. And I married a farmer.
72 utt 518.84 524.61 -0.0288  He's worked hard all his life. He bought this place to supplement his retirement. We hadn't been
73 utt 524.61 529.91 -0.4653  making any money. Balloon notes were coming due on tractors. He's needing to buy another rake. And
74 utt 529.91 535.05 -0.2374  now I'm telling him, oh, heck no, you ain't taking that red trailer up the road anymore. We're not selling
75 utt 535.05 540.26 -0.0798  any more calves. You send that red trailer up the road one more time. I'm following it. I'll go to the
76 utt 540.26 545.72 -0.1153  slaughterhouse if I have to. And it was a process for me because I mean, I love my husband. I didn't
77 utt 545.72 551.66 -0.7575  want to just say, you know, too bad. You go up the road. What I've been here is a catalyst for my
78 utt 551.66 560.16 -0.0253  husband to see a way that he's never been shown before because his history, his culture, his way of
79 utt 560.16 568.19 -0.0672  viewing the world is so grounded in tradition. Fourth generation cattle rancher, his great grandpa
80 utt 568.45 577.90 -0.1164  herded cows from San Antonio, by horse, whispers, and they had their own brand. And Tommy still has that.
81 utt 577.90 584.88 -0.0874  That means something to him to restore that history. So this is Tommy's heritage. For Tommy to say,
82 utt 584.88 593.71 -0.3762  um, you know, none of that meant anything is, doesn't come easy. But watching his wife change,
83 utt 593.71 599.89 -0.0382  watching his wife draw the line in the sand, watching his wife pull in all these people from
84 utt 599.89 606.47 -0.2081  around the world that are supporting us to, to build a sanctuary in the state of Texas is changing my
85 utt 606.47 615.29 -0.1471  husband. That's what's changing my husband. I kind of laughed at her and said it'll never work. And
86 utt 615.48 626.05 -0.3276  she has actually put me in my place now because the vegan world came to her rescue. I mean, she started
87 utt 626.05 633.51 -0.1632  meeting people that allied with her. It was incredible. And I started watching it and I
88 utt 633.51 641.05 -0.9167  couldn't believe what was going on. Uh, I still, it's kind of like a dream. Uh, they're incredible.
89 utt 641.05 649.40 -0.7493  Uh, if she has a problem, somebody in her network helps her out and it magically disappears.
90 utt 651.10 658.63 -0.0990  I think that we all have the power to change and to transform. And we see that every single day
91 utt 658.63 665.93 -0.3992  at Mercy for Animals. Someone whose family owned a cattle ranch decides to give up everything that
92 utt 665.93 672.43 -0.0640  they knew to be familiar to become a vegan animal rights activist. We see every single day the power
93 utt 672.53 681.58 -0.2602  that compassion has. Is it not better to light a candle than to curse the darkness? All the darkness
94 utt 681.58 690.00 -0.0432  in the world cannot put out the light of a single candle. I believe another world is possible.
95 utt 690.10 700.52 -0.1634  And on a quiet night, I can hear her breathing. It will be difficult. I know, but do not be afraid.
96 utt 700.86 709.50 -0.6028  Remember Mahatma Gandhi's words. First, they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you.
97 utt 709.50 720.42 -0.2842  And then you win. The brutes and the bullies have been Goliath. But David is coming. Maybe he's in this room.
98 utt 721.40 730.61 -0.1609  Maybe he's one of you. And if not you, who? And if not now, when?
99 utt 730.61 738.55 -2.4741  I'm a woman. Here's my daughter, Genesis Bowman. Thank you.
100 utt 746.20 753.56 -0.2068  Hi, my name is Genesis and I'm eight years old. I am vegan and an activist. Like my uncle Cesar
101 utt 753.56 759.02 -0.3268  Travis was. I am vegan because I don't believe animals should be put in slaughterhouses and circuses.
102 utt 759.02 764.31 -0.0967  People don't have to eat animals to live. All my favorite foods like pizza and mac and cheese,
103 utt 764.31 766.88 -0.1590  I can still eat. And a vegan version.
104 utt 769.87 774.98 -0.0821  I became an activist to protest for what's right to show kids they have a voice.
105 utt 774.98 780.68 -0.1969  I protest circuses and other places that imprison animals. I help people who are blinded.
106 utt 780.68 786.54 -0.1027  They don't know what's happening to the animals. I also leave to give information on what's happening
107 utt 786.56 793.36 -0.1174  and now to go vegan. I even talk to my friends. My goal is to get them to go vegan. I'm here for a
108 utt 793.36 799.70 -0.0566  purpose. My purpose is to get the whole world to go vegan. Thank you for helping me. Peace.
109 utt 804.94 806.28 -0.1954  Oh my God.
110 utt 809.43 814.39 -0.0914  She wasn't even four years old. She always had chicken nuggets. That was her favorite meal at the time.
111 utt 814.39 819.20 -0.0834  And so I read all the parenting books in the world because it was my first child. And a lot of books
112 utt 819.20 823.69 -0.1580  said if that's all they want to eat and they're picky, just let them eat chicken nuggets or whatever
113 utt 823.69 829.23 -0.2320  it is all day. And I just said, okay, well, I believe the commercials, the white meat and, you know,
114 utt 829.23 834.29 -0.2442  if you have milk with it or apples and the whole kids' meals and all that. And I would give it to
115 utt 834.29 838.46 -0.3823  her because it made her happy. And at least I thought it made her happy because I believe the
116 utt 838.46 843.19 -0.1000  advertisements and it didn't make her happy. And she just finally told me one day, she said,
117 utt 843.19 847.61 -0.5039  hey, mom, where do we get our food from? And I said, you know, we get it from the grocery store.
118 utt 847.61 853.15 -0.3737  And she said, no, that's not where we get it from. And she, she knew. And so I just,
119 utt 853.15 857.96 -0.2967  at that moment I knew I had a tough decision to make. Do I tell her the truth or do I just,
120 utt 857.96 862.37 -0.2699  you know, keep playing it off? And just my instincts came kicked in and I said, I'm going to tell her
121 utt 862.37 866.79 -0.1382  the truth because I always told myself as a parent, if my child asks me something,
122 utt 866.79 870.32 -0.2891  I'm going to give them the straight truth because, you know, that's what's needed.
123 utt 870.32 875.94 -0.0976  And I told her we kill animals for the food that she was eating. And she was devastated.
124 utt 875.94 880.83 -0.1394  And I didn't even know she knew what death meant at that age. And she just knew deep down inside.
125 utt 880.83 886.21 -0.8703  And she said, well, we have to kill. What is it? I said, well, chickens and cows. And I was explaining,
126 utt 886.21 891.34 -0.2139  you know, beef is from cows, like the burger. That's not beef. That's a cow. And you know,
127 utt 891.34 895.03 -0.2808  the chicken is the actual animal, the little bird. And she said, you know what,
128 utt 895.03 896.88 -0.0472  I don't ever want to eat this again.
129 utt 901.23 904.82 -0.1005  One of the great things, but the maddening things about being an animal rights activist
130 utt 905.17 910.84 -0.3634  is for the most part, we never have to convince people to care about animals. People already love
131 utt 910.84 919.27 -0.0170  animals. We just have to convince people to understand that the dog they love is emotionally
132 utt 919.29 926.33 -0.1884  the same as the cow they eat. You know, that's the disconnect. So it's aligning people's already
133 utt 926.33 931.63 -0.1182  existing love for animals with their actions. And so I look at someone like Genesis and to me,
134 utt 931.63 939.17 -0.7253  she just seems like she's, she's living her beliefs in a way that most people don't.
135 utt 939.43 945.67 -0.0968  You know, I mean, how many parents have had the experience with their kid where like their four
136 utt 945.67 950.00 -0.4927  year old, their six year old, their eight year old, their nine year old is eating a hamburger and says,
137 utt 950.00 955.94 -0.4643  mom, what is this? And the mom says, that's a hamburger. Well, where does it come from? A cow. And
138 utt 955.94 963.00 -0.2110  all of a sudden the child's horrified and the child almost has to like be taught to move past their
139 utt 963.00 969.02 -0.1679  horror. And one of our jobs is to remind them that no, their horror was justified. You know,
140 utt 969.02 973.76 -0.0697  the eight year old who's horrified at eating a hamburger, that's a legitimate response. It's a
141 utt 973.76 979.77 -1.0042  justified response. The 18 year old, the 28 year old who eats the hamburger as if there's no consequences
142 utt 979.80 987.40 -0.2023  for the environment for them or for animals. That's the mistake. This is my bunny. Her name's Charlotte.
143 utt 987.40 997.03 -0.3310  And my, my mom's friend and my friend named Nina gave it to me. And this is very special to me because
144 utt 997.45 1005.69 -0.1847  it only has one foot and I'm on a mission to find its other foot. Somebody has it. And I just
145 utt 1005.96 1011.39 -0.1602  have to find its foot because like, I don't think it's right just to have one foot.
146 utt 1012.30 1019.42 -0.4763  She told me about how the, the bunny, it wasn't like a natural bunny. It had been like ran through
147 utt 1019.42 1025.19 -0.2345  the mill, but she really was interested in it. And then when she brought it home and showed me it,
148 utt 1025.19 1033.46 -0.2694  and it was, it's kind of ugly, but, but it has character that it made sense to me, um, as far as
149 utt 1033.46 1039.16 -0.0990  with animals go, that not all of them look the same, but they all need love in their own way.
150 utt 1039.16 1045.26 -0.2152  You know, she's just a sweet girl. Just a sweet girl. Yeah.
151 utt 1045.60 1050.95 -0.1075  I don't feel that I shouldn't love her just because she has one foot. All animals should be loved.
152 utt 1050.95 1057.61 -0.0385  They shouldn't be tortured. Charlotte is awesome because each time I'm crying or sad,
153 utt 1057.61 1061.87 -0.1309  she's always there for me. And if I need a pal, she'll be there.
154 utt 1066.06 1070.69 -0.1514  One day I was nursing my baby and she came and she looked at her sister when I was nursing and she
155 utt 1070.69 1077.27 -0.6093  said, mom, where do we get milk? And I said, oh man, I'm going vegan today. I already knew it was,
156 utt 1077.27 1082.25 -0.4519  it was going to happen. It was a wrap. So we went vegan that day. From that point on,
157 utt 1082.25 1087.15 -0.1697  we never looked back. But I did look back a couple of times for a chocolate bar and she caught me.
158 utt 1087.15 1092.04 -0.5910  So, so when she caught me with the chocolate bar, she said, mom, she put her hand on her hip. I said,
159 utt 1092.04 1096.85 -1.1281  uh oh, I'm about to get lectured. She said, if you can't handle it, I can't. Don't think you have
160 utt 1096.85 1099.98 -0.3579  to go vegan just cause I am. She goes, I can do it on my own.
161 utt 1120.07 1125.34 -0.0462  Don't ever underestimate your own voice. When you speak with kindness and sincerity, people will
162 utt 1125.34 1131.36 -0.0675  listen. And every single leaflet that Genesis or I hand out has a potential to change one person's
163 utt 1131.36 1136.50 -0.1455  life forever. So don't ever forget, we just got to plant as many seeds as humanly possible. Some of
164 utt 1136.50 1140.11 -0.5456  them will grow, some of them will not, but we just got to, you know, keep fighting, keep being out there,
165 utt 1140.11 1144.52 -0.0481  keep educating the masses. You cannot get the truth from a corporation. We have to hit the streets,
166 utt 1144.52 1150.30 -0.2344  provide this information and people will respond to this message of kindness. So if she can get this,
167 utt 1150.30 1155.03 -0.1182  how can adults not get it? And that's why I'm so inspired by her. On her first day of school,
168 utt 1155.03 1159.61 -0.6648  she wore a love animals, don't eat them t-shirt. And her mother asked her after the first day of school,
169 utt 1159.61 1164.78 -0.3591  did they, did kids make fun of you or say anything during lunch? And Genesis says, yeah. And her mom's like,
170 utt 1164.78 1169.32 -0.5202  well, what did they do? She's like, oh, well, they waved hot dogs in my face. They rubbed salami on my cheeks.
171 utt 1169.32 1175.58 -0.7391  And her mom is like, well, did you cry? And Genesis is like, yeah, I cried. And then her mom's like,
172 utt 1175.58 1179.83 -0.6527  did you cry because they were making fun of you? And Genesis is like, oh, no, I cried because they
173 utt 1179.83 1185.13 -0.1089  didn't understand that they're hurting animals. The average person eats about 7,000 animals in their
174 utt 1185.13 1190.98 -0.0412  lifetime, if you include fish. So just spending 10 minutes handing out those 100 leaflets, that's going
175 utt 1190.98 1195.40 -0.4568  to save over the course of time thousands of animals from a life of horror we couldn't even begin to
176 utt 1195.40 1199.17 -0.6126  imagine. But every day we go out and leave a hand out a few thousand leaflets. We're getting tons of
177 utt 1199.17 1203.34 -0.9741  people to go vegan, others to go vegetarian, getting people to be aware of these issues,
178 utt 1203.34 1207.92 -0.1022  a first step. That's why the first step of any revolution is education. And that's what me and
179 utt 1207.92 1214.50 -0.5064  Genesis do all the time. At first, I wasn't really for it just because I know some some adults can be
180 utt 1214.50 1223.89 -0.2683  very rude to children and adults, vice versa. But as she did it and her mom's where I think
181 utt 1224.55 1232.39 -0.0245  it's hard to be mean to a child like that. I just kind of have a trust that they kind of see like a
182 utt 1232.39 1238.01 -0.0977  light in her that maybe it might happen to other people, but I just don't think it would happen to
183 utt 1238.01 1245.71 -0.8627  her. Otherwise, I wouldn't have her do it. It's just that she has she's so um it she opens up people.
184 utt 1245.71 1251.41 -0.0561  She makes people feel comfortable. So even the person that planned on being mean or usually is rude,
185 utt 1251.41 1257.19 -0.2164  they it's a weird thing that they're nice to her. She's just just like her name, the beginning,
186 utt 1257.19 1263.85 -0.2090  just Genesis. She's something new, something that we haven't seen before. It's just you don't see the
187 utt 1263.85 1271.39 -0.2113  stuff that she does. I've never seen kids do those things. So I'm comfortable with it. Yeah, I'm
188 utt 1271.39 1276.85 -0.5643  comfortable with it. When kids are young, they say, I want to be so and so when I get older. Well,
189 utt 1276.85 1282.15 -0.2322  I want to be Genesis when I get older because because just her spirit and her compassion and
190 utt 1282.15 1287.20 -0.0841  to wake up every day and see her here at my house, it's just awesome. And to see how it spreads out to
191 utt 1287.20 1292.26 -0.2651  the whole family. Everybody, you know, has a lot of compassion for animals, for other humans, for
192 utt 1292.26 1297.55 -0.1648  homeless. Like we'll even see homeless people and my little boy will cry if we can't give him a dollar.
193 utt 1297.55 1301.73 -0.1198  And you know, it's all started with Genesis just reminding us that we need to be a little more
194 utt 1301.73 1307.10 -0.0202  compassionate, not just to other humans or to our family members, but to everyone else in the world,
195 utt 1307.12 1314.40 -0.1842  including animals. Children have a natural connection with other animals. And then as time goes, we become
196 utt 1314.40 1321.31 -0.0568  acculturated to accept certain things that don't feel right. We come to believe that it's okay for
197 utt 1321.49 1329.41 -0.0842  cruelty to become normal. And we become adulterated in a sense, instead of following our instincts and
198 utt 1329.41 1337.27 -0.0897  our humane intuition and our natural empathy. And so I think holding onto that childhood perspective
199 utt 1337.38 1343.21 -0.0749  and connection with animals and nature is very valuable. And it's a beautiful thing when children
200 utt 1343.31 1347.87 -0.0932  who are young and hold onto that continue with it throughout their life.
201 utt 1360.89 1368.49 -0.0385  I knew that something wasn't right. I knew that I wasn't drinking like other people. I was passing out,
202 utt 1368.49 1375.71 -0.0499  getting alcohol poisoning, blacking out, getting sick, drinking before school, things that normal
203 utt 1375.71 1383.02 -0.2491  10th graders don't quite do. I had a lot of trauma in my life. And I think that's a common thread with
204 utt 1383.02 1392.16 -0.3193  people that develop some substance abuse problems. The divorce and not having a present father and
205 utt 1392.27 1401.23 -0.0907  our family was ripped apart. Alcohol, that was the elixir that helped kind of make things feel a little
206 utt 1401.23 1408.61 -0.7062  bit better. I would go into 7-elevens and stores like that and literally steal the alcohol from the
207 utt 1408.61 1414.63 -0.0307  coolers, put it down my pants, and then go drink the alcohol by myself behind the building. After high
208 utt 1414.63 1420.81 -0.0655  school, I started taking trips to South Florida, Miami, South Beach more, and I started getting into
209 utt 1420.91 1424.18 -0.0020  heavier drugs on a regular basis.
210 utt 1435.92 1444.24 -0.0614  After that year or so, I started getting more into cocaine. And by the time I was 25,
211 utt 1444.24 1452.75 -0.0488  I was a daily drinker and user and cigarette smoker and very unhealthy. And I honestly should not be
212 utt 1452.75 1460.77 -0.3439  here right now. I should be dead. I did almost overdose many times. I've been in nasty car accidents
213 utt 1460.77 1465.27 -0.0692  where the people have come to the scene of the accident and they've seen the vehicle and they said,
214 utt 1465.27 1471.93 -0.1623  you don't need to go to the hospital. I've committed felonies that I've gotten away with
215 utt 1472.43 1479.95 -0.1753  plenty of times. I just acted, you know, very immorally and very recklessly. And, you know,
216 utt 1479.95 1484.85 -0.5156  I just didn't care. I didn't care. It was almost like it was a cry for help. It was just like,
217 utt 1485.19 1486.53 -0.3956  saved me.
218 utt 1494.90 1500.74 -0.0782  I called my brother and I called him in the middle of the night and I was crying to him on the phone.
219 utt 1500.74 1507.64 -0.1018  And I apparently I said that I needed help. I still to this day don't recall that, but that's what
220 utt 1507.64 1514.38 -0.1635  he said. And I believe him, love my brother to death. And so I went to go visit and
221 utt 1515.36 1519.84 -0.1176  my sister was there, my brother was there, my sister-in-law was there, my mother was there,
222 utt 1519.84 1523.37 -0.1488  and my little niece was there. And we were sitting around and talking and
223 utt 1523.37 1530.51 -0.5071  and then all of a sudden the tone kind of changed a little bit. And, and I think it was my mom who said,
224 utt 1530.51 1536.21 -0.2153  you know, well, the real reason we wanted to all get together today and talk to you is we wanted to
225 utt 1536.31 1543.35 -0.3062  talk to you about your, your problem that you have. And so I was there with all my loved ones and
226 utt 1544.33 1549.45 -0.4030  they all went around the room and they told me how I've affected them, which I didn't think I did.
227 utt 1549.45 1553.54 -0.3989  I thought I'm only affecting myself. This is my life. Let me do what I want. You do what
228 utt 1553.54 1561.08 -1.1559  you want. I didn't realize that's the selfishness and self centeredness of, of, um, this affliction.
229 utt 1561.08 1567.26 -0.2688  So they all went around and told me and I was blown away and they said, we'll help you if you help
230 utt 1567.26 1576.81 -0.9553  yourself. So I checked myself into a, uh, 28 day rehab, you know, like they say, uh, a huge tree can grow
231 utt 1576.81 1583.39 -0.2481  from a tiny mustard seed. And that's, that's where I began.
232 utt 1585.02 1591.98 -0.1727  People want to ask me so many questions about ultra running or being vegan or, or this and that.
233 utt 1591.98 1598.88 -0.5374  It's like, it's really simple. It's just simple, you know, it's, uh, just about the love really.
234 utt 1598.88 1601.85 -0.2552  And that's, that's really the void that was filled.
235 utt 1604.68 1606.50 -0.5104  Good job, buddy.
236 utt 1606.50 1609.95 -0.3123  Oh, wow.
237 utt 1609.95 1611.64 -2.3674  That was such a huge part.
238 utt 1612.06 1612.92 -1.4638  Yeah.
239 utt 1612.94 1614.61 -0.7621  Hey, Goosey.
240 utt 1615.03 1616.45 -1.2599  Good job.
241 utt 1616.56 1617.98 -0.4839  How are you?
242 utt 1618.08 1623.19 -0.0935  It was such a nice surprise to see him come up to me. His whole body was, it wasn't just like his tail
243 utt 1623.19 1628.65 -0.2081  was wagging. It was like his whole body was just wiggling back and forth and, oh, it just really
244 utt 1628.65 1636.11 -0.1237  warmed my heart. The, the relationship between dogs and humans is quite profound.
245 utt 1636.46 1645.42 -0.2245  I didn't have the responsibility to have my own pets in the past. So the time was right now to get a dog
246 utt 1645.42 1653.29 -0.0646  and to be a vegan, you realize more and more how much animals have been used as commodities.
247 utt 1653.29 1660.67 -0.2060  We don't need to use them for money. Realizing that this animal has such feelings and such love.
248 utt 1660.77 1664.76 -0.1163  You think just dogs are like that or other animals too?
249 utt 1665.35 1673.51 -0.9304  Are cows like that or pigs like that, you know? So that was, uh, quite a shift for me.
250 utt 1673.51 1678.40 -3.8183  So, we're going to go to the park.
251 utt 1678.40 1679.69 -2.8181  Hey, Goosey.
252 utt 1679.69 1680.49 -1.9489  How's it going?
253 utt 1680.49 1681.21 -2.9600  Good. How are you?
254 utt 1681.21 1682.66 -2.0854  Yeah, good. How was the race?
255 utt 1682.66 1685.15 -0.1769  Oh, it was really fun, but it was tough.
256 utt 1685.15 1686.51 -0.3412  I'm sure you killed it.
257 utt 1687.09 1689.56 -0.2873  I'm looking forward to a float, definitely.
258 utt 1689.56 1690.36 -3.1757  Yeah. Awesome.
259 utt 1690.36 1693.17 -1.1487  The tank is all ready. You're in Floaterium. You can head on up.
260 utt 1693.17 1694.13 -0.7020  Sweet. Thank you.
261 utt 1694.13 1694.85 -1.6304  You're welcome.
262 utt 1694.85 1695.42 -1.6170  See you in a bit.
263 utt 1695.42 1696.22 -2.4945  See ya.
264 utt 1696.22 1716.68 -0.5788  Bye-bye
265 utt 1716.68 1717.00 -2.7838  new
266 utt 1739.65 1741.00 -1.3288 好評
267 utt 1741.02 1741.80 -3.5283  subtitles
268 utt 1744.55 1745.25 -0.8648  OK
269 utt 1745.25 1745.57 -3.2480  Oh
270 utt 1745.57 1746.05 -2.0077  Oh
271 utt 1761.88 1767.00 -0.3573  Ever since I jumped in the cab of that truck and started driving it, it's actually pretty
272 utt 1767.00 1767.32 -0.1104  cool.
273 utt 1767.32 1769.32 -0.0874  I feel pretty badass.
274 utt 1770.39 1775.10 -0.1145  It's a very big truck and it's very heavy as well, so it's not just the size of it,
275 utt 1775.10 1780.16 -1.0444  but to break takes a while because it's like 13,000 pounds.
276 utt 1781.30 1785.61 -0.0884  It's kind of cool getting up there and driving this big old truck.
277 utt 1787.32 1791.31 -0.4292  We live in the wine country, so this is our bread and butter around here.
278 utt 1791.31 1792.44 -1.0553  There's so many wineries.
279 utt 1792.44 1794.44 -0.1941  I don't think anyone's ever physically counted them.
280 utt 1794.44 1795.73 -0.2760  There's too many to count.
281 utt 1796.39 1801.42 -0.2403  When you're looking at that big of a presence with wineries, it's just important to utilize
282 utt 1801.42 1802.23 -0.0115  the resource there.
283 utt 1802.23 1803.11 -0.0708  I mean, why not?
284 utt 1803.11 1804.63 -0.0634  This stuff is really good.
285 utt 1804.73 1809.61 -0.3657  The best thing for me, and that's why I change up my menu all the time, is to just get in
286 utt 1809.61 1812.90 -0.2126  the kitchen and say, I wonder what this would be like if I added this to it.
287 utt 1813.08 1819.88 -0.4008  This whole rap that vegan food has had about being tasteless, it's just a bad rap.
288 utt 1819.90 1822.85 -0.6083  People say to me all the time, oh, I've had vegan food.
289 utt 1822.85 1823.81 -0.1586  It's not very good.
290 utt 1823.81 1825.58 -1.0892  I'm like, yeah, me too.
291 utt 1825.58 1827.18 -0.2311  I've had bad vegan food too.
292 utt 1827.18 1828.95 -0.1977  I've had bad pizza.
293 utt 1828.95 1831.92 -0.0300  If you care, I think, that the food is good.
294 utt 1831.92 1836.01 -0.2553  I really care that not only the food is good, that it's knee buckling, that it's exceptional,
295 utt 1836.27 1841.87 -0.7059  you know, if I'm making something, I'll taste it and like, yeah, this is really good, but
296 utt 1842.85 1844.35 -0.1874  my knees aren't buckling yet.
297 utt 1844.35 1847.16 -0.3206  I need something to go, ah, yes.
298 utt 1848.55 1853.02 -0.0325  I think that people just need to come out and try it.
299 utt 1853.02 1856.71 -0.2732  The word vegan, they think fake, and it's not.
300 utt 1856.73 1861.53 -0.0121  And the taste is just out of this world.
301 utt 1861.53 1866.58 -0.2503  And a lot of people say, you know, once they eat it, they're like, I don't even need to
302 utt 1866.58 1871.88 -0.1270  go out and have, you know, that hamburger from that place after I've eaten her food.
303 utt 1871.88 1878.06 -0.5441  So you just need to get over the idea that it's a fake food because it's not.
304 utt 1878.06 1882.79 -0.2332  And I would say too that a lot of people have this impression that, oh, she's a vegan or he's
305 utt 1882.79 1883.35 -0.7206  a vegan.
306 utt 1883.35 1884.56 -0.8209  They eat carrots, right?
307 utt 1884.56 1885.52 -2.9334  Or they eat a celery.
308 utt 1885.78 1888.89 -0.3144  No, food, real and good food.
309 utt 1888.89 1892.42 -0.0629  And you don't have to be vegan to come out and try vegan food.
310 utt 1895.25 1901.09 -0.4049  I noticed this older gentleman with his veteran's hat and all these pins and looking a little
311 utt 1901.09 1905.66 -0.1196  out of place, a little uneasy, you know, with, I'm not sure I recognize half the food on the
312 utt 1905.66 1906.23 -0.0755  menu.
313 utt 1906.23 1907.11 -0.0491  What is this?
314 utt 1907.11 1910.24 -0.5187  I'm not, you know, a little unease, a little unease there.
315 utt 1910.24 1913.29 -0.2383  I know you told me not to tell dad that it was vegan.
316 utt 1913.29 1915.37 -1.1401  I met the daughter, urging him on.
317 utt 1915.37 1917.78 -0.5047  Usually you've got a partner in crime there.
318 utt 1917.88 1920.67 -0.1678  No, I have never tried vegan food before.
319 utt 1920.67 1921.23 -0.1760  Thank you.
320 utt 1921.23 1922.11 -0.9127  Enjoy.
321 utt 1922.11 1924.12 -0.0518  I have a general idea.
322 utt 1924.78 1929.58 -0.1814  It's non-meat, basically.
323 utt 1951.83 1953.41 -0.0549  It's pretty good.
324 utt 1955.12 1963.20 -0.4295  And she was really worried today for me coming here about vegan and told me to eat something
325 utt 1963.20 1964.16 -0.0069  at home.
326 utt 1964.75 1966.33 -0.0582  Well, I didn't.
327 utt 1966.33 1970.02 -0.2412  And I thought, you've got to have something.
328 utt 1970.85 1972.59 -0.0652  And I'm quite surprised.
329 utt 1972.61 1974.11 -0.0879  It was very good.
330 utt 1974.11 1975.32 -0.0342  It is very good.
331 utt 1975.32 1976.36 -0.0065  I will finish it.
332 utt 1976.46 1978.69 -0.0552  I could use a napkin.
333 utt 1978.69 1984.71 -1.3136  And I was like, in the evening when I go by and I'm just walking by their table really
334 utt 1984.71 1988.64 -0.3206  quick and the daughter grabs my arm and pulls me over to the table and she's like, I've
335 utt 1988.64 1992.65 -0.5037  got to tell you, he's never had vegan food before and he loved it.
336 utt 1992.65 2000.19 -0.7292  And I was like, it makes my heart proud because now vegan food is accessible, you know?
337 utt 2000.19 2003.08 -0.0591  It's not a weird out there thing.
338 utt 2019.80 2025.79 -0.0575  As far as being an animal lover, it was nothing that at the time when we first met that it
339 utt 2025.79 2029.32 -0.0585  was anything that was out there.
340 utt 2029.32 2034.46 -0.2526  But now that she has a vegan food truck, she does a lot of events for the SPCA and other
341 utt 2034.56 2037.91 -0.0262  organizations like that and donates to their cause.
342 utt 2038.41 2040.00 -1.2946  That's my favorite piece.
343 utt 2040.00 2040.96 -1.3014  Yes, I know.
344 utt 2040.96 2042.00 -2.1070  What would you have?
345 utt 2042.10 2047.94 -0.1302  My wife's a vegan, so that means no leather products, no leather shoes, no leather belts,
346 utt 2047.94 2052.44 -0.0252  no leather handbags, nothing that's derived from animals whatsoever.
347 utt 2052.44 2060.86 -0.0811  And at first when she brought this up, especially being a vegan, because of my ignorance of diet
348 utt 2060.86 2064.31 -0.2710  at the time, you're thinking, okay, where are you getting your protein?
349 utt 2064.31 2065.76 -0.0462  Where are you getting your calcium?
350 utt 2065.76 2068.40 -0.1443  Where are you getting all these vitamins and things like that?
351 utt 2068.40 2073.86 -0.2203  And it turns out nature in the plant form provides all that stuff.
352 utt 2074.28 2077.39 -0.0268  You just have to eat a well-balanced diet.
353 utt 2077.39 2079.96 -0.1059  If you're wondering about, am I going to get enough protein?
354 utt 2079.96 2084.53 -0.0411  Go out to the nearest rural area, pick the biggest bull you can find.
355 utt 2084.53 2089.19 -0.0805  Or go to a racetrack, find the biggest, strongest stallion you can see.
356 utt 2089.19 2092.64 -0.0529  Go to the zoo, look for the tallest giraffe, the biggest elephant.
357 utt 2092.66 2098.34 -0.1957  All of those animals got those rippling muscles entirely from plant foods.
358 utt 2098.34 2099.46 -0.0777  Those are vegans.
359 utt 2099.46 2102.19 -0.7412  So yeah, you know, now a pussycat is a meat eater.
360 utt 2102.19 2105.24 -0.4742  So it's not like eating a lot of meat is going to make you big.
361 utt 2105.24 2108.21 -0.0059  You get plenty of protein from plants.
362 utt 2108.39 2115.27 -0.0229  Research is now clearly showing that a plant-based diet beats every other diet.
363 utt 2115.27 2119.60 -0.1280  And the federal policymakers are taking notice of that.
364 utt 2120.02 2125.06 -0.1279  If Jerry's cooking a plant-based diet, I have no problem with that.
365 utt 2125.06 2131.00 -1.2509  Ten years ago, I would have gone out to the store and bought some meat to add on to it,
366 utt 2131.10 2132.28 -0.0487  but not anymore.
367 utt 2132.28 2137.66 -0.5649  Now that I'm starting to understand that you can get all these nutrients, you can get the
368 utt 2137.66 2146.40 -0.1682  protein, you can get everything you need from a plant-based diet, then the fears go away.
369 utt 2146.83 2153.39 -0.0082  The dietary guidelines for Americans are reformulated every five years to be the blueprint for what
370 utt 2153.39 2154.43 -0.0114  you're supposed to eat.
371 utt 2154.43 2160.69 -0.0728  That means every kid in school, every food assistance program, really every nutrition program is
372 utt 2160.69 2164.46 -0.0033  supposed to adhere to the dietary guidelines for Americans.
373 utt 2164.46 2165.90 -0.0353  They're a big deal.
374 utt 2166.41 2172.81 -0.1177  In the year 2000, we sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture because we found that six of the
375 utt 2172.81 2178.66 -0.0159  11 members on the committee had financial ties to the meat industry, the milk industry, the
376 utt 2178.66 2179.87 -0.0046  egg industry.
377 utt 2179.87 2181.47 -0.0073  We won that lawsuit.
378 utt 2181.47 2183.80 -0.0832  That opened up the process dramatically.
379 utt 2183.80 2186.85 -0.1371  And ever since then, the guidelines have gotten better and better and better.
380 utt 2186.85 2192.63 -0.1259  To run a business, you can't be sitting on your butt all day being tired.
381 utt 2192.81 2196.32 -0.0206  So you have to have a balanced diet.
382 utt 2196.32 2203.06 -0.4368  And I think by her being a vegan, by having a plant-based diet, her energy levels are higher.
383 utt 2203.06 2205.39 -4.0295  Since then, you may have to have an effective diet.
384 utt 2205.39 2256.58 -3.0048  During the year teal Gemeentes and E beads persons are paid off the 조
385 utt 2256.58 2257.47 -1.3203  I'm amazed
386 utt 2257.89 2262.76 -0.2933  Renee, she puts her mind on something and she goes for it.
387 utt 2262.76 2267.58 -0.0504  Since she started this, I haven't got to visit very much because she's been so overwhelmed.
388 utt 2267.58 2271.59 -0.2149  But I've been following her on Facebook and it's been very interesting.
389 utt 2271.59 2274.80 -0.0689  I think I'm impressed.
390 utt 2275.86 2278.17 -0.0383  Good for her. That's wonderful.
391 utt 2278.17 2281.86 -0.0381  You know why? I can't claim to be a vegan by any means,
392 utt 2281.86 2286.84 -0.0244  but she has inspired me to change my way of looking at things.
393 utt 2286.84 2291.01 -0.0306  And she has opened my eyes to some things that I did not know existed.
394 utt 2292.64 2296.31 -0.0526  They were trained gentle with kindness. They have no fear.
395 utt 2296.31 2301.36 -0.0708  You know, a lot of people go to their pasture for a horse and they run the other way.
396 utt 2302.27 2306.74 -0.0665  They don't want you to be around them. These guys, they're okay with it.
397 utt 2306.76 2310.11 -0.4783  They're family, most definitely. Most definitely.
398 utt 2310.21 2315.00 -0.2514  I've had him 23 years and he'll die on my property.
399 utt 2315.00 2321.34 -0.2826  I mean, he'll be here until he grows old and sees his last day, won't you?
400 utt 2321.34 2321.98 -0.3362  Yes.
401 utt 2322.01 2326.72 -0.1403  He was an accident. He wasn't on purpose, but we love him just the same.
402 utt 2332.52 2334.34 -0.4610  Here we go, Herman.
403 utt 2353.62 2356.73 -0.0791  We heard about what Renee was doing out here for these animals.
404 utt 2356.73 2360.26 -0.0670  And when the opportunity came up, I knew she had all this going on.
405 utt 2360.26 2363.79 -0.1016  It was kind of a time crunch, but I felt like I had to be a part of it, really.
406 utt 2363.79 2365.32 -0.1430  She's doing a good thing out here.
407 utt 2365.32 2368.05 -0.2722  You know, and anytime that you get an opportunity to do something like this,
408 utt 2368.05 2369.81 -0.2310  it's, you know, I try to jump on it.
409 utt 2369.81 2370.85 -0.4980  Okay, Herman.
410 utt 2374.41 2377.03 -0.0987  Yeah, I'm sure we're probably going to hang around to watch.
411 utt 2377.03 2380.16 -0.1870  Yeah, we've put a lot of time and effort into this and this is going to be his home
412 utt 2380.16 2382.81 -0.1166  and it'll make us feel really good to see him happy in it.
413 utt 2382.99 2387.55 -0.2401  Oh, Herman, oh, Herman, we love you so much.
414 utt 2387.55 2390.11 -0.1029  We see your soul behind your eyes.
415 utt 2390.11 2392.28 -0.4233  We know you had it rough.
416 utt 2392.28 2396.37 -0.5564  Oh, Herman, oh, Herman, we love you so much.
417 utt 2396.40 2399.34 -0.0932  We see your soul behind your eyes.
418 utt 2399.34 2401.75 -0.2506  We know you had it rough.
419 utt 2402.09 2407.45 -0.1783  What resonates with me with Renee is that she, you see the motto on my shirt,
420 utt 2407.45 2408.65 -0.1155  that's the motto of the shelter.
421 utt 2408.65 2410.02 -0.0308  Every animal matters.
422 utt 2410.02 2411.46 -0.1179  Every single one.
423 utt 2411.46 2416.60 -0.0530  And for her, that is this personified.
424 utt 2422.40 2425.74 -1.1640  Look, Houdini's meeting him for the first time.
425 utt 2425.77 2426.87 -0.8723  Aw.
426 utt 2427.13 2428.79 -1.3728  Okay, I'll kiss you.
427 utt 2429.54 2431.36 -1.2984  He's already trying to convert me.
428 utt 2432.91 2434.97 -2.0239  All right, Renee, I'm going to get out of here.
429 utt 2434.97 2435.85 -0.2199  Thank you for everything.
430 utt 2435.85 2436.26 -4.7523  I appreciate you.
431 utt 2436.26 2436.90 -1.9760  No problem.
432 utt 2436.90 2437.70 -0.1735  No problem.
433 utt 2437.70 2438.50 -0.2377  So much.
434 utt 2438.50 2441.07 -1.3595  I'll be back out here on Monday to take care of a few little things, okay?
435 utt 2441.07 2441.55 -0.8718  Thank you.
436 utt 2441.55 2442.11 -5.1243  Yes, ma'am.
437 utt 2442.11 2445.08 -1.3717  You know that you wouldn't be doing this project if you weren't going to go vegan.
438 utt 2445.08 2447.17 -0.2336  So do your research.
439 utt 2447.17 2448.05 -0.4015  You got it.
440 utt 2448.05 2449.02 -3.5636  Bye, girl.
441 utt 2449.02 2449.50 -3.9320  Bye.
442 utt 2449.50 2450.14 -3.2201  Bye.
443 utt 2450.14 2450.54 -5.0163  Bye.
444 utt 2450.56 2451.26 -2.9780  Bye.
445 utt 2451.26 2451.74 -4.0972  Bye.
446 utt 2451.74 2453.75 -0.2225  None of us had any options for this pig.
447 utt 2453.75 2455.44 -0.0674  She was this pig's way out.
448 utt 2455.44 2460.57 -0.4105  But I just learned that he apparently went into his house this morning at 9.30 when the gates
449 utt 2460.57 2461.61 -0.1567  opened here at 10.
450 utt 2461.61 2463.06 -0.0446  That's a beautiful story.
451 utt 2464.04 2471.97 -0.1196  If you are here to be part of the show and watch the entertainment and the speakers, the only
452 utt 2471.97 2474.94 -0.0935  way we're going to know you're here is if you're in the front.
453 utt 2474.96 2475.82 -0.2844  All right?
454 utt 2475.82 2478.47 -0.0578  I know we got vendors out there, and that's important.
455 utt 2478.47 2481.19 -0.0898  But we want to see who's here for a moment.
456 utt 2483.06 2484.40 -0.2309  I know, right?
457 utt 2484.59 2486.25 -1.2962  No 231?
458 utt 2486.83 2488.50 -1.1302  232?
459 utt 2490.36 2491.95 -1.2303  233?
460 utt 2493.49 2495.00 -0.8657  234?
461 utt 2495.10 2496.76 -0.4536  You got 234?
462 utt 2496.78 2498.37 -0.8370  All right, you won.
463 utt 2498.37 2500.13 -0.6964  All right, come on.
464 utt 2503.85 2506.95 -0.2115  97 people showed up to buy tickets.
465 utt 2506.95 2514.10 -0.3017  And with those 97 people, we raised about $8,300.
466 utt 2515.32 2519.87 -0.2747  I had people putting $1,000 in my hand, cash.
467 utt 2519.87 2523.08 -0.2623  I had people putting $100 bills in my hand.
468 utt 2523.35 2527.74 -0.1840  You know, just me walking around, not to mention what happened in the office.
469 utt 2527.84 2530.55 -0.0276  Not to mention what happened afterwards.
470 utt 2530.55 2533.68 -0.1683  I mean, there's just, there was an outpouring.
471 utt 2562.10 2564.73 -0.1390  I'm a surgeon, but I specialize in weight loss.
472 utt 2564.73 2567.30 -0.4344  So I do weight loss surgery and medical weight loss diets.
473 utt 2567.30 2569.39 -0.5048  And I teach people plant-based diets.
474 utt 2569.39 2573.96 -0.0170  The vegan diet works for diabetes, heart disease, cancer.
475 utt 2573.96 2575.48 -0.3187  What, do I have a bug in my hair?
476 utt 2575.75 2577.89 -0.2601  They don't even want to kill bugs, so.
477 utt 2578.56 2583.75 -0.2868  And it's just been, you know, it's just changed the way I treat people in medicine.
478 utt 2583.75 2586.00 -0.3813  It's my first line of treatment.
479 utt 2586.00 2588.00 -0.5826  Our number one cause of death is heart disease.
480 utt 2588.00 2589.85 -0.2309  Heart disease is completely preventable.
481 utt 2589.85 2593.54 -0.2188  You do not have to have heart disease, even if you're genetically predisposed to it.
482 utt 2593.54 2597.71 -0.2228  If you eat a plant-based diet, you won't, or especially vegan diet, you're very unlikely
483 utt 2597.71 2599.40 -0.6507  to get a, get heart disease.
484 utt 2599.40 2603.57 -0.3910  And same with diabetes, same with certain types of cancer, same with obesity.
485 utt 2603.57 2605.50 -0.4321  This is all can be cured with diet.
486 utt 2609.69 2612.48 -0.0900  Children are not really attracted to eating meat.
487 utt 2612.48 2615.29 -0.1356  That's something that we kind of push on children.
488 utt 2615.29 2617.21 -0.0914  And we let them choose whatever they want.
489 utt 2617.21 2620.10 -0.1623  And pretty soon they decided they didn't want to eat animals.
490 utt 2620.10 2624.19 -0.2723  When they figured out, this one was like, isn't it weird that there's a chicken out in
491 utt 2624.19 2626.12 -0.5131  the farm and there's a chicken that you eat?
492 utt 2626.12 2628.21 -0.3776  And it was like, well, no, they're the same thing.
493 utt 2628.21 2629.73 -0.3167  And she was like, they're the same thing.
494 utt 2629.73 2632.22 -0.3698  And then that was, that was it for eating chicken.
495 utt 2638.18 2645.22 -0.0619  We are an animal farm sanctuary becoming the first ever beef cattle ranch to transition
496 utt 2645.24 2649.47 -0.0055  to a vegan farm sanctuary in the state of Texas.
497 utt 2650.54 2655.81 -0.2142  You know, so it doesn't surprise me that we don't have hundreds of people here today, honestly.
498 utt 2655.81 2659.02 -0.3664  But, but, you know, but it's coming.
499 utt 2659.02 2660.23 -0.0664  Oh, you just wait.
500 utt 2660.23 2660.71 -0.2509  It's coming.
501 utt 2660.71 2664.16 -0.5393  And Texas consciousness is waking up.
502 utt 2664.16 2669.21 -0.0993  And what's really cool is these fine folks, I was talking to Joy the other day and I was
503 utt 2669.21 2670.82 -0.0439  telling her what we do.
504 utt 2670.92 2678.36 -0.6218  And she said to me, Renee, you know, we, we have cows here like Texas longhorns.
505 utt 2679.10 2684.06 -0.0897  Sometimes the cows, the little babies would go to FFA kids and they fall in love with these
506 utt 2684.06 2684.94 -0.0008  cows.
507 utt 2684.94 2692.81 -0.0413  And if they go to auction, which most of them do, they do get sold and they do go to slaughter.
508 utt 2692.91 2697.38 -0.1743  So we are going to get to adopt Frosty.
509 utt 2697.38 2700.99 -0.2686  And Frosty is going to be our first ever Texas longhorn here.
510 utt 2700.99 2705.48 -0.1518  He'll be out here in the pasture with Herman and the rest of the rowdy bunch.
511 utt 2708.40 2716.24 -0.0746  As she started making a sanctuary, I started reflecting back about my whole life and the way I thought
512 utt 2716.24 2717.44 -0.0373  about animals.
513 utt 2717.54 2724.58 -0.6033  And I was kind of relieved because now the, if this, I was thinking, wow, if this works,
514 utt 2725.57 2729.72 -0.1477  I can have a bunch of pet cows and I don't have to take them to market.
515 utt 2729.72 2732.45 -0.3448  And Renee would say, they're not pets.
516 utt 2732.45 2734.21 -0.1256  They are individuals.
517 utt 2734.21 2737.74 -0.2381  And I said, okay, we can have a bunch of individuals.
518 utt 2741.06 2742.08 -2.2272  Bullseye.
519 utt 2742.08 2743.36 -0.8633  How you doing, girl?
520 utt 2743.54 2744.81 -1.0926  How you doing?
521 utt 2747.56 2749.22 -0.4815  How you doing, girl?
522 utt 2749.72 2754.92 -0.0551  I wanted to go to a slaughterhouse and I wanted to see exactly what was happening there.
523 utt 2754.92 2758.29 -0.2067  And I wanted to do a little bit of filming.
524 utt 2758.29 2765.99 -0.0679  And so I asked a friend of mine, a close physician, friend of mine actually, who I knew his uncle
525 utt 2767.14 2770.81 -0.0054  was the general manager of a large slaughterhouse.
526 utt 2770.81 2775.70 -0.2376  I asked him just, I thought they would say no, but I asked anyways if there was any possibility
527 utt 2775.70 2776.74 -0.1051  that I could do that.
528 utt 2776.74 2779.87 -0.0863  And to my surprise, they said yes.
529 utt 2780.78 2787.18 -0.3316  Prior to being slaughtered, the animals were so desperately fighting for their lives.
530 utt 2787.18 2793.68 -0.0095  They were so moving around violently and jerking around that when they were supposed to be
531 utt 2793.68 2795.84 -0.0103  killed, they were really not even killed.
532 utt 2795.84 2798.65 -0.0520  Many times they were just injured or weakened.
533 utt 2798.65 2804.11 -0.0827  Actually, that's what I saw that happened most of the times with the cows, that they would
534 utt 2804.11 2810.37 -0.1974  hit a captive bolt more so down the neck instead of in the head because probably because of the
535 utt 2810.37 2814.62 -0.0793  reason that it's not easy to hit them in a strategic point with those conditions.
536 utt 2814.64 2823.21 -0.0398  And so the animals would fall to the ground and they would put a shackle in the hind leg.
537 utt 2823.39 2827.62 -0.0552  And now these animals were still alive.
538 utt 2827.62 2830.11 -0.0388  The cows were still completely alive.
539 utt 2830.11 2832.76 -0.1015  And they were even making movements with their hair.
540 utt 2832.76 2837.97 -0.2971  They weren't as strong to walk out and leave the place, but they were still making movements.
541 utt 2837.97 2841.74 -0.1358  And they were still conscious and their eyes were wide open.
542 utt 2841.74 2849.85 -0.2786  And then the slaughterhouse worker would put the shackle and they would be hanging by their hind leg.
543 utt 2849.85 2857.39 -0.1416  And then a worker would come up to like a platform so that he would be at the same level of the cow.
544 utt 2857.39 2859.56 -0.0512  And then he would get close to the cow.
545 utt 2859.56 2871.19 -0.1299  And then he would cut off the legs of the cow, like from the knee down, the three legs except for the leg from where she was hanging from.
546 utt 2871.19 2874.32 -0.0294  And then the three legs would fall to the floor.
547 utt 2874.99 2880.34 -0.0325  And then he would come close to her again and lift up the tail of the cow.
548 utt 2880.34 2884.84 -0.0578  And from the very tip of the tail, he would make a vertical incision.
549 utt 2884.84 2887.97 -0.0359  I don't know how deep or superficial, but a vertical incision.
550 utt 2887.97 2889.97 -0.1729  And then put the object down.
551 utt 2889.97 2903.13 -0.1537  And then he would pull the skin of the cow down so that the cow's own skin was hanging next to her own head on both sides of her head.
552 utt 2903.48 2907.47 -0.0857  And then he would make an incision in her neck.
553 utt 2907.47 2909.87 -0.1694  And then blood would come gushing out.
554 utt 2909.87 2912.28 -0.1031  And she would start choking on her own blood.
555 utt 2912.28 2914.85 -0.0609  And then eventually she would die.
556 utt 2917.84 2920.63 -0.0165  I went to the holding areas.
557 utt 2920.63 2924.32 -0.2739  First of all, I saw that these animals were really, really terrified.
558 utt 2924.32 2930.26 -0.0763  And somehow they all knew what was going on because they would start walking back and being afraid of us.
559 utt 2930.44 2936.11 -0.5799  Even, you know, even in the holding areas because somehow they sensed that something wasn't right.
560 utt 2936.11 2937.48 -0.0784  I think, I think.
561 utt 2937.48 2945.02 -0.2042  But at the end of the holding areas visit, I saw some of the cows were housed individually.
562 utt 2945.02 2947.59 -0.1994  Some of them were housed, like, in very large groups.
563 utt 2947.59 2948.71 -0.2132  I'm not sure why.
564 utt 2948.71 2953.13 -0.1174  But at the end, there was a cow that housed, that was housed individually.
565 utt 2953.13 2959.15 -0.0238  This was a huge, beautiful, completely white cow.
566 utt 2959.17 2962.11 -0.0231  And she was terrified.
567 utt 2962.11 2965.00 -0.2039  Like, you could see that she was really, really anxious.
568 utt 2965.00 2966.93 -0.1938  She was, she was really afraid.
569 utt 2966.93 2969.18 -0.3040  I, I have a feeling that somehow they know.
570 utt 2969.18 2974.47 -0.3552  I don't know why they would know, but maybe they can smell the blood because it was right adjacent to the south.
571 utt 2974.47 2976.24 -0.1580  Maybe they can smell it or I don't know.
572 utt 2976.24 2978.16 -0.0340  But she was really nervous.
573 utt 2978.16 2979.69 -0.1098  And we were at the end of the visit.
574 utt 2979.69 2984.90 -0.2799  So I asked the guy who was giving me the tour, if you want to call that, or the visit, who was with me.
575 utt 2984.90 2987.07 -0.1441  And I asked him if I could stay there with the cow.
576 utt 2987.07 2988.19 -0.2124  So he stayed with me.
577 utt 2988.19 2992.05 -0.0813  And we were talking with the cow for about 15 or 20 minutes.
578 utt 2992.05 2992.61 -0.1576  I was.
579 utt 2992.61 2993.89 -0.5974  He was standing there.
580 utt 2993.89 2996.38 -0.0900  But she calmed down.
581 utt 2996.38 2998.71 -0.1274  And I was even petting the cow.
582 utt 2998.71 3000.71 -1.1789  And, and she really calmed down.
583 utt 3000.71 3003.60 -0.1248  And she was in much better conditions.
584 utt 3004.10 3015.32 -0.0221  But then the next day, when I went to the actual slaughter facility, and when I was filming all of these horrible things that I just told you,
585 utt 3015.32 3018.37 -0.3128  it came the turn of all of the cows.
586 utt 3018.37 3023.58 -0.0164  It came the turn of that white, beautiful cow to go through slaughter.
587 utt 3024.01 3034.74 -0.0248  And it was so much harder because the fact that this white cow wasn't, she didn't even fight back like the other cows.
588 utt 3034.74 3036.74 -0.0014  She could smell the blood.
589 utt 3036.74 3038.19 -0.1271  She could hear the other cows.
590 utt 3038.19 3039.87 -0.6426  She knew exactly what was going on.
591 utt 3039.87 3047.42 -0.2654  But for some reason, I think she thought that I was going to help her because she came, she even like positioned herself.
592 utt 3047.42 3049.98 -0.1028  Like they didn't have to shove her in too much.
593 utt 3049.98 3059.05 -0.6003  The, the workers were like shoving the other cows and the other cows were jumping on their, I mean, getting on their hind legs.
594 utt 3059.07 3061.70 -0.0167  They were trying to crawl the wall.
595 utt 3061.70 3070.13 -0.3502  And this white cow, she just went straight up to me because I was about, about half a meter away from where their heads were with my camera.
596 utt 3070.13 3072.85 -0.0944  And she walked straight up to me.
597 utt 3073.04 3075.82 -0.0698  And she was just staring at me.
598 utt 3075.93 3082.81 -0.0722  And the other workers were pushing her and then the door, the metal door closed behind her.
599 utt 3082.91 3086.26 -0.0279  And even with all of that, she was not fighting back.
600 utt 3086.26 3092.44 -0.0782  All that she was doing was with her eyes wide open, she was standing still and she was staring at me.
601 utt 3092.44 3093.88 -0.0375  She wasn't even blinking.
602 utt 3093.88 3096.53 -0.0975  Like she was begging for me to help her.
603 utt 3096.53 3102.39 -0.4918  Somehow she, she probably sensed that I didn't want to, you know, for this, for this to happen.
604 utt 3102.39 3107.04 -0.1067  And obviously, you know, obviously I didn't want that to happen, obviously.
605 utt 3107.04 3111.77 -0.3961  Um, but it was so hard because she was just imploring for me to help her.
606 utt 3111.77 3115.06 -0.0483  And there was absolutely nothing that I could do.
607 utt 3139.32 3140.74 -0.0419  Don't give up.
608 utt 3141.01 3145.24 -0.0636  Just got to focus and find some comfort within the discomfort.
609 utt 3145.24 3145.80 -2.0378  Okay.
610 utt 3145.80 3148.77 -0.3334  We're going to work on some lateral movements, speed skaters.
611 utt 3148.77 3149.41 -0.6047  Okay.
612 utt 3149.41 3152.46 -0.3778  We're going to go to the side, alternating legs.
613 utt 3152.46 3153.26 -0.8169  Okay.
614 utt 3153.26 3157.68 -0.5567  In five, four, three, two, one, go.
615 utt 3158.42 3160.40 -0.2668  Get a nice T position.
616 utt 3161.39 3162.97 -0.2180  And hold them out.
617 utt 3162.97 3165.54 -0.1206  Four minutes beginning now.
618 utt 3168.53 3171.40 -0.0990  And those little voices start coming into your head.
619 utt 3171.40 3172.44 -0.7233  They tell you to quit.
620 utt 3172.44 3173.56 -0.4212  Tell you to give up.
621 utt 3173.56 3175.57 -0.2131  Just like in life when it gets tough.
622 utt 3175.57 3176.61 -0.1646  You don't give up.
623 utt 3176.61 3178.06 -0.0542  You can override that.
624 utt 3178.06 3180.47 -0.3294  Push past and come out on the other side.
625 utt 3180.49 3184.64 -1.4453  We'll be hooking you guys up big time.
626 utt 3186.02 3188.41 -1.1070  One, two, three.
627 utt 3192.12 3195.31 -0.6486  I met Yasin in Ithaca, New York.
628 utt 3195.31 3201.09 -0.8429  Um, this quirky little town where I was on the faculty at Cornell.
629 utt 3201.09 3212.16 -0.4550  And Yasin was living, um, with his brother and sister-in-law, um, kind of in the out, on the outskirts of the city.
630 utt 3212.16 3215.53 -0.0359  And he came to one of my yoga classes.
631 utt 3215.53 3218.18 -0.6507  Uh, I was teaching yoga at the time.
632 utt 3218.18 3221.47 -0.0234  And that was the beginning.
633 utt 3221.47 3223.48 -0.3696  He kept coming back to the classes.
634 utt 3223.48 3225.56 -0.1792  And he was really bad at yoga.
635 utt 3225.59 3228.69 -0.0439  And he would come to the meditation classes as well.
636 utt 3228.69 3235.60 -0.2188  And he was worse at that because he needed, like, ten props, blankets, pillows.
637 utt 3235.62 3242.58 -0.3408  Um, my teacher spent, like, twenty minutes just getting him comfortable because his body is so tight.
638 utt 3243.56 3247.47 -0.0877  He had long, wavy hair and a ponytail.
639 utt 3247.47 3250.12 -0.5448  And he was kind of bigger than he is now.
640 utt 3250.12 3259.03 -0.1539  And, and I started to think, wow, this guy keeps coming to these classes and he's really bad at it.
641 utt 3259.03 3262.56 -0.3021  I wonder if, um, he likes me.
642 utt 3266.99 3271.55 -0.0195  We went away on a honeymoon to Costa Rica before we got married.
643 utt 3271.55 3275.80 -0.0544  And then right after we got married, we went to the farm sanctuary in upstate New York.
644 utt 3275.80 3277.24 -0.2327  And we stayed overnight there.
645 utt 3277.24 3280.94 -0.0603  And we had an amazing experience connecting with the animals.
646 utt 3280.96 3286.23 -0.0048  I also remember going on a vacation with him to some South American country.
647 utt 3286.23 3290.32 -0.3367  And they asked him, why don't you eat meat?
648 utt 3290.32 3296.34 -0.1120  You know, they didn't ask me, but for the man not to be eating meat in this South American country was really weird.
649 utt 3296.34 3301.00 -0.8380  And so Yassine said, um, because I don't want to hurt animals.
650 utt 3301.18 3305.57 -0.0225  And the waiters laughed at him.
651 utt 3308.08 3319.45 -0.7841  And I thought that that was just so authentic, um, and brave of Yassine to show that empathy to others.
652 utt 3319.45 3326.68 -0.3999  I think it was a big moment for him because it was one of the first times he had been challenged or asked, uh, why?
653 utt 3326.78 3330.77 -0.1646  And he didn't, at that time, didn't say like all the health benefits.
654 utt 3330.77 3334.62 -0.1895  His immediate response was because of the animals.
655 utt 3334.62 3341.36 -0.0369  And that's really representative of the kind of person that he is.
656 utt 3345.56 3349.71 -0.0516  Not only are runners vegan, but they're actually performing at a high level.
657 utt 3349.71 3354.20 -0.0153  I think that is out there on the table now that you do get enough protein.
658 utt 3354.20 3355.81 -0.5626  That's not a question anymore.
659 utt 3355.81 3365.11 -0.1614  Us vegan runners kind of stick together and kind of know of each other and are kind of proud of each other when we do perform on a high level on a big stage.
660 utt 3369.87 3381.48 -0.7703  One thing, uh, I really do enjoy is cooking for vegans and non-vegans in my home and seeing their eyes light up about how good it is and how full they feel.
661 utt 3381.48 3383.81 -0.0820  Because I think a lot of people have a misconception.
662 utt 3383.81 3390.23 -0.1196  They feel like they're not going to get satiated or they're not going to be filled up because they don't have a big hunk of meat to fill their belly.
663 utt 3390.57 3395.21 -0.3588  I love when people come over and they're just like, wow, that was an amazing dish.
664 utt 3395.21 3396.73 -0.0590  Oh, I feel so good.
665 utt 3396.73 3399.78 -0.0566  And it was all plant-based.
666 utt 3399.78 3400.90 -1.4992  Thank you.
667 utt 3400.90 3401.71 -1.8628  Enjoy.
668 utt 3402.69 3404.35 -3.3245  There's other, like other pancakes.
669 utt 3404.46 3406.92 -1.0269  Hey, before we start eating, I want to make a toast.
670 utt 3406.92 3410.53 -0.0391  I really thank you guys for coming over and cheers to everybody.
671 utt 3410.53 3411.90 -0.8950  Good luck this weekend.
672 utt 3411.90 3412.46 -2.9875  You can see.
673 utt 3412.46 3413.58 -2.5747  Absolutely.
674 utt 3413.58 3414.87 -0.1880  Run strong.
675 utt 3416.01 3423.21 -0.0843  After dinner the night before a race, I love to go out for a nice slow shakeout run with my friends.
676 utt 3430.22 3436.21 -0.4480  The first time I met Yassine was a 50 mile race just outside of Seattle called the White River 50 miler.
677 utt 3436.21 3441.75 -0.5710  And I was running along and all of a sudden this guy comes up to me and he starts talking my ear off like, hey, I went vegan.
678 utt 3441.75 3442.87 -0.4218  You know, you really inspired me.
679 utt 3442.87 3444.32 -0.5919  And he was just going nuts.
680 utt 3444.32 3446.00 -0.3692  I'm like, you know, who is this guy?
681 utt 3446.00 3449.53 -0.5084  And at the same time, like, wow, he's really got an energy to him.
682 utt 3449.53 3453.06 -0.2543  And he, I thought, you know, would drop off eventually.
683 utt 3453.06 3457.48 -0.1352  But he just hung with me for the next, like, five miles up this brutal climb.
684 utt 3457.48 3461.65 -0.1383  And, you know, he had as much energy in his voice as he did in his heart and lungs.
685 utt 3461.83 3468.07 -0.9031  Yassine is just one of those charismatic, you know, runners and ultra runners where we're an interesting and odd bunch.
686 utt 3468.07 3472.24 -0.2350  But we also kind of like, you know, we can pick up wherever we left off.
687 utt 3472.24 3477.06 -0.7836  And I think that's, that's the beauty of our sport as well as a vegan diet.
688 utt 3477.06 3483.40 -0.0641  You know, again, we're connected by a certain thread and that is running and being vegan.
689 utt 3483.40 3491.66 -0.2802  So it's always great to come back and just hang out and hang out as buddies and as if nothing, as if no time has really passed.
690 utt 3491.69 3494.87 -0.0616  We're just the same individuals at the core.
691 utt 3495.38 3502.10 -0.7700  So in 1999, I'm lined up for my first Western States 100 mile race, probably the biggest race I was in.
692 utt 3502.10 3506.99 -0.7635  I was competing in my life and I just transitioned to a vegan diet that winter.
693 utt 3506.99 3510.44 -0.3715  And there's still doubts in my head, you know, can this really work for me?
694 utt 3510.44 3515.58 -0.1541  And I was thinking, you know, I probably need to eat some meat here even a week up to the race.
695 utt 3515.58 3520.31 -0.0147  And after I won that race on a plant-based diet, there was no looking back.
696 utt 3520.31 3525.77 -0.2179  I had never doubted myself and went on to win seven consecutive Western States 100 mile races.
697 utt 3526.59 3530.10 -0.1844  Scott Jurek was the pioneer vegan runner.
698 utt 3530.10 3535.00 -0.1081  And now we're starting to hear more and more it being more mainstream.
699 utt 3535.90 3550.73 -0.0749  Last year, Scott, after running the Appalachian Trail, which is over like 2,000 miles across 14 states, covering elevation changes of 500,000 feet, broke the Appalachian Trail record by over three hours.
700 utt 3554.68 3559.31 -0.1243  There are a lot of parallels of, you know, ultramarathoning and becoming vegan.
701 utt 3559.31 3561.24 -0.0251  You don't just jump right into it.
702 utt 3561.24 3575.68 -0.3771  Sometimes you need to, you know, find that community, you need to try it out for, I tell people to try it out for at least a month to give them some time for your body to adapt to a different cuisine, different diet.
703 utt 3575.86 3582.02 -0.1142  Your body's not quite used to it. It takes a few weeks for the human body to adapt to things.
704 utt 3582.02 3591.33 -0.3481  That's usually why they tell people to go to rehabilitation, for example, for 28 days, is so their body can adapt to the new lifestyle.
705 utt 3591.51 3596.71 -0.3031  Oh, you just want your belly rubbed, don't you? You just want your belly rubbed.
706 utt 3599.94 3610.67 -0.0747  There's definitely a correlation between the spiritual practice of non-harming and veganism and the way I'm living today compared to the way I used to live.
707 utt 3610.67 3616.37 -0.0467  The way I used to live was very harmful to myself, to my body, to my loved ones.
708 utt 3616.55 3628.08 -0.0725  Essentially, I'm trying to live a more spiritual life, and for me, that involves trying to cause as little suffering as possible and to try to just do my best.
709 utt 3628.35 3634.50 -0.0416  And this is very much in alignment with how I'm living today and how I want to live.
710 utt 3635.49 3639.56 -0.5057  This idea of eating animal products, nothing more harmful than that shit.
711 utt 3639.74 3646.54 -0.1429  What's more harmful than destroying the planet and taking all the resources and then poisoning yourself?
712 utt 3646.54 3651.44 -0.9109  You know, the first chakra, don't poison yourself, right? Take care of yourself so you can serve the planet.
713 utt 3651.44 3656.89 -0.1150  So the first thing you do is you're poisoning yourself because the way the animal product is being manufactured, for one,
714 utt 3656.99 3663.87 -0.3115  aside from the fact that the plant-based diet is safer and healthier no matter what, but the way they make the animal product,
715 utt 3663.87 3669.41 -1.1567  the way it's born into—talk about suffering, a hundred billion animals made to be born into suffering.
716 utt 3669.59 3681.45 -0.8809  So, yeah, we don't want to cause any harm. So if we really examine ahimsa and its meaning or if we want to be people who practice ahimsa
717 utt 3681.45 3687.71 -0.3167  or cause less harm, the one thing we shouldn't do, I mean the first and most important thing we should do,
718 utt 3687.71 3690.27 -0.1500  is get away from eating animal products.
719 utt 3691.26 3692.92 -0.6975  You can do whatever you want.
720 utt 3693.10 3699.50 -0.4643  You can create any world you want when you're painting, right? Nothing is wrong when you're painting.
721 utt 3702.17 3705.68 -0.0889  See this little vine over here? You can make a monkey anywhere you want.
722 utt 3706.35 3708.09 -0.0972  Genesis, what's your favorite?
723 utt 3708.09 3708.73 -0.4949  A pig.
724 utt 3708.73 3709.29 -3.0783  A pig?
725 utt 3709.29 3709.94 -0.4329  A pig.
726 utt 3710.20 3712.82 -0.1168  So you guys know what abstract art means?
727 utt 3712.93 3714.51 -0.5372  Uh, no.
728 utt 3715.65 3720.85 -0.9186  Art for Animals Sakes mission is to teach art classes with an animal empathy theme.
729 utt 3720.85 3725.66 -0.0470  So we try to instill compassion for animals through art projects.
730 utt 3725.66 3733.69 -0.1489  And the reason why we use art, it gives youth especially a meaningful way of looking at the issues that we're talking about.
731 utt 3733.69 3738.82 -0.0217  So we try to get kids to come to their own conclusions about animals and how they should be treated.
732 utt 3738.82 3747.25 -0.2324  Somebody once famously said if you gave a kid a bunny rabbit and an apple, they're going to eat the apple and play with the bunny rabbit.
733 utt 3747.25 3751.58 -0.1139  You know, so it's just sort of like this thing gets knocked out of us as we get older.
734 utt 3752.33 3760.81 -0.1357  One of the projects that we did was a lantern project and we were basically protesting an animal experimentation lab.
735 utt 3760.81 3763.22 -0.0506  And so we just made these beautiful handmade lanterns.
736 utt 3763.22 3767.15 -1.3873  We had over 280 people from across the United States ship them to us.
737 utt 3767.15 3774.37 -0.3827  And we put them in a public place and people saw these lanterns and they were, they gravitated to it because it was such a beautiful display.
738 utt 3774.37 3775.90 -0.4501  And they said, what is this all about?
739 utt 3775.90 3785.21 -0.2895  And we said, well, actually every one of these lanterns represents one of these animals that is going to be experimented on in this lab that they're going to be building soon.
740 utt 3785.21 3796.60 -0.0236  And so by putting something beautiful in the world and enticing a conversation, I think brings people in instead of revolting them or putting them on the defensive.
741 utt 3798.63 3808.72 -0.4403  With Genesis and her age group, I think they're really benefiting from this age because the information is out there and it's whether they want to recognize it, they want to see it.
742 utt 3808.72 3826.29 -0.1832  And she has become such a good spokesperson because she has a strong feeling, but she also has sort of the background and the education, whether she's gotten it on her own or through her parents, to put it into practice.
743 utt 3826.29 3838.17 -0.0818  And I think that's why she's become such a powerful spokesperson at this age, because people see the innocence, but they also see the maturity and the intellectual maturity.
744 utt 3838.17 3849.73 -0.3468  that she brings to the subject. And it's really hard to, you know, talk to a kid and have them say these things that are so basic and so unfiltered and refute it. You just can't.
745 utt 3850.07 3862.16 -0.7994  He was spending the night one night and he's like, what are we going to eat because you guys are vegan? And we're like, well, what do you like? He said, I like meatball subs. So we said, well, we'll serve you that.
746 utt 3862.16 3867.46 -0.3055  So then I was talking to him about veganism and then my mom made a sandwich.
747 utt 3867.46 3881.66 -0.4907  He ate it and he's like, oh, this is really good. So then after that, he left. And then his mom called back. He's like, Tahir wants to go vegan now. And that was the happiest thought I've ever thought.
748 utt 3883.53 3889.13 -0.6952  David Carter, NFL defensive lineman, 300 pound vegan.
749 utt 3889.55 3895.55 -0.1412  Genesis Butler, quarterback, 75 pound vegan.
750 utt 3902.87 3907.58 -0.3505  I'm going to crush you like a little bug, but I don't crush bugs because I'm vegan.
751 utt 3908.09 3910.79 -1.4097  Got insurance? Means you're going to need it.
752 utt 3925.74 3926.92 -1.6722  Need it.
753 utt 3926.92 3927.65 -3.0702  Tucker.
754 utt 3927.65 3929.33 -2.4513  Doesn't make sense.
755 utt 3933.36 3935.19 -0.2740  Hey, good game, Genesis.
756 utt 3935.19 3935.99 -0.3448  Thanks.
757 utt 3935.99 3937.84 -0.2510  Those were just some of my basic moves.
758 utt 3937.84 3939.68 -0.3684  Next time I'll show you some of my real moves.
759 utt 3939.70 3942.01 -0.2159  You know, you talk a lot of trash.
760 utt 3944.12 3951.32 -0.2501  These boys challenged me to a push-off and my mom sent me in this cute little white sparkly blouse.
761 utt 3951.32 3955.25 -0.7376  And then the boys do like 10 push-ups and they're like, oh, I can't take anymore.
762 utt 3955.25 3958.70 -0.4029  Then I'm like, okay, so I can do more. I did a hundred push-ups.
763 utt 3958.70 3965.36 -0.3987  And then I come home, my shirt's all dirty. It's all like black. And my mom's like, what happened?
764 utt 3965.36 3974.27 -0.6419  I'm like, I did push-ups and I did it on the blacktop. And she's like, next time scoot over to the grass a little bit. And she had to throw it away. It was just...
765 utt 3974.29 3978.68 -0.5679  Oh man, I feel sorry for those boys. That must have been a real shot to their ego, huh?
766 utt 3978.68 3987.59 -0.5277  When I first started going vegan, I met this 72-year-old guy. His name is Victoris Kovinskis. And I was doing like a hundred push-ups and I thought I was doing a lot.
767 utt 3987.61 3999.55 -0.2472  For me, that's what I thought at that time was a lot. But he was doing 200 push-ups at 72 years old in one time. So that was like our little competition. And now I'm doing like 500 push-ups.
768 utt 3999.55 4006.37 -0.6357  So they were messing with you, huh? All the guys thinking that because you were vegan, you couldn't do push-ups and you beat them and you obliterated them.
769 utt 4006.37 4014.47 -0.1485  Yeah, that happened to me. See, everybody was thinking because I was going vegan and I was going to be all weak and small and stuff and never be able to play again.
770 utt 4014.47 4022.82 -0.1122  But I did lose some weight. I got down to 265, but then I put on another 40 pounds of just solid muscle and now I'm stronger than all of them.
771 utt 4022.82 4030.28 -0.6147  So vegan is clearly the best way to go. You know that too. And those little boys that you beat in the push-up contest, they know that too now.
772 utt 4030.62 4037.82 -1.0899  Oh, so another thing your mom told me about was the football game when you showed up in ballerina shoes?
773 utt 4037.82 4045.61 -0.3899  Oh, so I came from a circus protest and we thought it was my brother's game so it was going to be alright.
774 utt 4045.61 4052.27 -0.5819  And he was in his jersey. He was ready. I come, my team's on. They're like, come on, where are you?
775 utt 4052.29 4058.37 -0.4704  And then I had like my save the elephant shirt on. I had everything on, all my protest stuff.
776 utt 4058.37 4064.87 -0.5065  So then they make this 12 alligator rule. It was just like five alligator first.
777 utt 4064.87 4068.56 -0.0727  So now it goes up to 12 because I was pulling flags like that.
778 utt 4068.66 4076.58 -0.4076  I remember when I was playing pop winner. It was the defensive line had to wait five alligators before we could go rush the quarterback.
779 utt 4076.58 4080.84 -0.2188  So they pushed it up because of you to 12 alligators.
780 utt 4080.84 4086.94 -0.3679  Like you were supposed to do for five alligators, one alligator, two alligator, three all the way to five.
781 utt 4086.94 4091.59 -0.1932  So then they pushed it up to 12. So that's like half of the game. The game's almost over.
782 utt 4091.69 4094.80 -0.2938  Genesis, count two more alligators. Fight!
783 utt 4094.90 4099.53 -0.2427  One alligator, two alligator, three alligator, four alligator, five.
784 utt 4099.53 4103.15 -0.5617  So then I do 12 alligators. Go get them!
785 utt 4103.41 4107.64 -0.2591  But I still catch their flags so couldn't do nothing about them.
786 utt 4107.64 4113.98 -0.3441  So they tried to cheat to stop you from sticking, taking their flags and they still ended up looking bad.
787 utt 4113.98 4115.74 -0.3981  There were some big guys too.
788 utt 4115.74 4118.23 -0.1753  Man, how many touchdowns did you score that game?
789 utt 4118.23 4119.52 -0.4194  Five to zero.
790 utt 4119.52 4123.53 -0.8353  Wait, so the score was five to zero. Who scored all the, you scored all the touchdowns?
791 utt 4123.87 4129.95 -0.7595  So you scored, you scored, and this is all boys, right? You're playing against all boys.
792 utt 4129.95 4130.67 -2.4839  I'm not a girl.
793 utt 4130.67 4135.89 -0.5765  All meat eaters and you're the only girl and you're the only vegan and you scored all the touchdowns.
794 utt 4135.89 4141.18 -0.4277  And they had to push the alligators up to 12, from five alligators to 12 alligators.
795 utt 4141.18 4143.67 -0.0420  Just to stop you from snatching all the flags.
796 utt 4143.93 4149.61 -0.2901  Man, shoot, you're doing a better job than me with all this football stuff.
797 utt 4149.61 4151.05 -0.7068  That's right, girl.
798 utt 4159.18 4161.16 -2.1870  horse is throwing away.
799 utt 4161.16 4177.29 -2.2411  P seating in reverse once was that court.
800 utt 4177.29 4178.74 -5.4879  He's beating out much, okay?
801 utt 4178.74 4179.86 -0.0141  We shall overcome
802 utt 4180.28 4181.79 -0.1385  We shall overcome
803 utt 4182.05 4184.19 -0.1834  We shall overcome someday
804 utt 4184.54 4185.96 -0.1144  Oh deep in my heart
805 utt 4185.96 4186.92 -0.2534  I do believe
806 utt 4186.94 4188.85 -0.0909  We shall overcome someday
807 utt 4189.75 4191.50 -0.0436  We'll walk hand in hand
808 utt 4192.08 4193.66 -0.0883  We'll walk hand in hand
809 utt 4193.77 4195.19 -0.1994  We'll walk hand in hand
810 utt 4195.45 4197.76 -0.1439  We'll walk hand in hand someday
811 utt 4198.58 4199.76 -0.0440  Deep in my heart
812 utt 4199.94 4201.13 -0.2177  I do believe
813 utt 4201.15 4203.21 -0.1199  We shall overcome someday
814 utt 4204.04 4205.54 -0.0211  You are not alone
815 utt 4206.36 4207.79 -0.0167  You are not alone
816 utt 4208.37 4210.84 -0.0661  You are not alone today.
817 utt 4211.10 4216.05 -0.5841  Deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome someday.
818 utt 4216.31 4218.38 -0.0363  We shall overcome.
819 utt 4218.56 4220.63 -0.0479  We shall overcome.
820 utt 4220.81 4223.68 -0.3472  We shall overcome someday.
821 utt 4223.86 4230.02 -0.0851  Deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome someday.
822 utt 4230.02 4257.06 -3.3879  Deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome someday.
823 utt 4257.06 4260.67 -0.5620  I also don't like to use the word typical vegan because I don't know what a typical vegan is anymore.
824 utt 4260.67 4262.52 -0.1191  I don't know if there's such a thing.
825 utt 4264.22 4272.79 -0.5428  I think that sort of 70s version of the tree-hugging, crystal-powered, Birkenstock-wearing unicorn rider is sort of nonsense and has been for a long time.
826 utt 4274.49 4281.21 -0.1355  I left home right after college and I ended up walking, actually, all the way from New England to Tennessee.
827 utt 4281.21 4286.99 -0.1726  And I ended up in Tennessee at a community called The Farm, which at that time was the largest hippie commune in the world.
828 utt 4286.99 4290.60 -0.1079  There was about almost 1,000 people there and they were all vegetarians.
829 utt 4290.60 4292.37 -0.1720  In fact, we would today call them vegans.
830 utt 4292.37 4294.94 -0.5100  No one heard of the word vegan in 1975.
831 utt 4296.24 4298.71 -0.0364  I fought competitively for many, many years.
832 utt 4298.71 4307.45 -0.2591  I still train and there's nothing more satisfying than getting into the ring with a guy who's 20 years younger than I am and just completely handing him his ass.
833 utt 4308.68 4311.87 -0.0206  Nine years later, I shaved my head.
834 utt 4311.87 4318.05 -0.0836  And for the second time in my life, I found myself in a community that was vegan.
835 utt 4318.05 4321.82 -0.3835  This was Sangwangsa Zen Monastery in South Korea.
836 utt 4321.82 4327.84 -0.0572  And I went there and became a Zen monk with the idea of doing an intensive meditation.
837 utt 4327.84 4337.23 -0.2659  And I realized, though, that these people in this monastery had been living what we would call a vegan way of living for 750 years.
838 utt 4337.97 4341.08 -0.2196  I can remember one of my old coaches who was super traditional.
839 utt 4341.08 4344.77 -0.6508  He was about 1,000 years old, old Chinese guy, who used to say, you've got to be more aggressive.
840 utt 4344.77 4345.65 -0.5353  You've got to eat more meat.
841 utt 4345.65 4347.90 -0.6444  You've got to eat more meat and be more aggressive.
842 utt 4348.64 4352.87 -0.0221  So there was no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no wool, no silk, no leather.
843 utt 4352.87 4355.20 -0.3660  Even mosquitoes you wouldn't just kill.
844 utt 4355.20 4356.81 -0.4888  You would put them outside.
845 utt 4358.51 4367.40 -0.4052  And then at the same time, he would sit us all down for two-hour meditations and say, walk the middle path and embrace freedom and balance.
846 utt 4367.40 4371.01 -0.1224  Now get in there and kick that guy's ass and bring home a trophy for the school.
847 utt 4372.40 4378.63 -0.0507  The whole idea was that if we want to evolve in consciousness and become more awake,
848 utt 4378.63 4383.29 -0.0219  then the fundamental, most important thing is kindness to others.
849 utt 4384.99 4390.67 -0.1558  And it's that same sort of cognitive dissonance that says, I can pet my dog and love my golden retriever,
850 utt 4390.67 4393.00 -0.1215  and then I can eat a double bacon cheeseburger.
851 utt 4393.26 4396.29 -0.4287  And it simply never made sense to me.
852 utt 4398.15 4400.22 -0.0302  We are all interconnected.
853 utt 4400.22 4403.83 -0.0083  The interconnectedness of life is the fundamental spiritual teaching.
854 utt 4403.83 4410.25 -0.0796  And from understanding that more deeply, we liberate ourselves as we liberate others.
855 utt 4412.04 4416.03 -0.0475  We are all on this crazy rock flying through the universe, and we're in it together.
856 utt 4416.03 4418.92 -0.5090  And I know it sounds, again, it sounds a little crystal-powered,
857 utt 4418.94 4422.93 -0.0218  but it's really the only thing that we know for sure,
858 utt 4422.93 4425.50 -0.0995  which is that we're all adrift in a sea of chaos, you know?
859 utt 4425.50 4428.63 -0.0764  And the mountain is not there, and me and the trees are here.
860 utt 4428.63 4430.15 -0.0569  I am the trees, and I am the mountain.
861 utt 4430.15 4431.68 -0.7612  And we are all on the rock together.
862 utt 4431.68 4434.32 -0.0111  And that is the more sublime change that happens
863 utt 4434.32 4438.02 -0.0691  after one realizes that we can't slaughter and eat our fellow earthlings.
864 utt 4439.64 4444.11 -0.1113  The whole idea of veganism is really a social transformation,
865 utt 4444.11 4446.04 -0.0108  but also a personal transformation,
866 utt 4446.04 4450.85 -0.0541  based on awakening out of the delusion of being a fundamentally separate self
867 utt 4450.88 4453.50 -0.0138  and competing with others to get something,
868 utt 4453.69 4457.35 -0.1140  rather to see that as we bless others, we are blessed.
869 utt 4479.85 4484.32 -0.4172  For Amy's with no cheese, that would be completely vegan?
870 utt 4485.46 4489.45 -0.9193  Yeah, but we also can do, to get four vegan Amy's,
871 utt 4489.45 4491.46 -0.0142  I can do them with vegan cheese.
872 utt 4491.48 4492.42 -0.3637  Oh, okay.
873 utt 4492.42 4493.47 -0.4698  Well, actually, you know what?
874 utt 4493.47 4495.55 -0.2127  I think I'm fine without the cheese, vegan or not.
875 utt 4495.55 4496.84 -0.3224  But that, wow, that's great.
876 utt 4496.84 4497.64 -0.1061  That's good to know.
877 utt 4497.64 4498.12 -0.5091  Okay.
878 utt 4498.12 4499.48 -2.9368  About four Amy's with no cheese?
879 utt 4499.48 4500.93 -0.4703  Four Amy's, no cheese.
880 utt 4500.93 4506.47 -0.1754  And then I need two non-dairy chocolate and two non-dairy strawberries.
881 utt 4506.47 4510.08 -2.0973  Back in the day in 1970, when I first became a vegan,
882 utt 4510.08 4511.92 -0.4212  you know, a lot of those veggie meats,
883 utt 4511.92 4514.89 -0.1336  I won't name the brand because they're good people that tried hard.
884 utt 4514.89 4517.30 -0.1828  But, you know, they were, you know,
885 utt 4517.30 4520.67 -0.0469  I'm not sure if that veggie meat was good for your body,
886 utt 4520.67 4522.52 -0.0243  but it certainly wasn't good for your soul.
887 utt 4522.52 4526.29 -0.6773  You know, it was kind of like, well, I'm just going to eat this anyway.
888 utt 4526.29 4530.86 -0.3034  It was kind of the inner monologue whenever you would eat some of that stuff.
889 utt 4530.86 4533.59 -0.0229  But it got so much better over the years.
890 utt 4533.59 4538.24 -0.1403  And now, you know, you can go to any restaurant and they have vegan dishes.
891 utt 4538.24 4540.33 -0.1432  You know, nearly any restaurant has that.
892 utt 4540.33 4541.29 -0.7807  And they're delicious.
893 utt 4541.29 4545.55 -0.1999  And people realize just because you're a vegan doesn't mean you don't like flavor.
894 utt 4545.57 4547.39 -0.0070  Garlic is just fine.
895 utt 4547.39 4549.64 -0.1513  You know, cayenne pepper is just fine.
896 utt 4549.64 4550.92 -0.0220  Ginger is wonderful.
897 utt 4550.92 4552.53 -0.1586  You know, put some flavor into it.
898 utt 4552.53 4553.97 -0.0871  And that's what I do when I cook.
899 utt 4553.97 4556.14 -0.0013  I make a number of wonderful dishes.
900 utt 4556.14 4558.71 -0.6403  I have a spicy Thai basil eggplant I make.
901 utt 4558.71 4559.91 -0.7480  I make a wonderful curry.
902 utt 4559.91 4563.60 -0.0326  I have a chicken with peanut sauce with fake chicken, of course.
903 utt 4563.60 4567.45 -0.1065  You know, Trinidad squash, Greek potatoes.
904 utt 4567.45 4570.26 -0.4643  I have all these wonderful dishes filled with flavor that people,
905 utt 4570.26 4572.67 -1.0383  big meat eaters that come to my house, they love it.
906 utt 4572.67 4575.88 -0.1087  And they begrudgingly go meat free for the day.
907 utt 4575.88 4578.13 -0.7472  But then when it's done, when the meal's done, they go,
908 utt 4578.13 4579.57 -0.3447  you know what, I could do this again.
909 utt 4579.57 4581.58 -0.0910  I may do this a little more often.
910 utt 4582.64 4584.06 -0.4096  It's exciting.
911 utt 4584.06 4590.97 -0.5319  I'm a vegan sitting in a drive-thru ordering a burger and a shake and fries.
912 utt 4592.27 4593.61 -0.1761  Very cool.
913 utt 4594.84 4599.55 -0.6649  I didn't fully understand the green aspects of it back in 1970.
914 utt 4599.55 4601.40 -0.3247  But by the early 90s, I did.
915 utt 4601.40 4606.21 -0.8640  You know, it takes so much more land and water and energy to create a pound of beef
916 utt 4606.21 4608.62 -0.0745  than it does a pound of broccoli or a pound of grain.
917 utt 4608.62 4612.55 -0.1148  So it's the green choice in many ways, land use, energy, water, you name it.
918 utt 4612.73 4615.12 -0.1407  Right now on my truck it says vegan.
919 utt 4615.62 4623.15 -0.1272  I'm really considering rebranding into plant-based because I am finding that that is more accessible
920 utt 4623.15 4624.03 -0.0030  to people.
921 utt 4625.09 4626.19 -1.1570  It's the same thing.
922 utt 4626.19 4627.48 -0.2733  It's the same food.
923 utt 4627.48 4638.55 -0.0557  But unfortunately, I think that over time, vegan has created a whole other layering of meaning,
924 utt 4638.55 4644.17 -0.1065  which sometimes can mean militant and people get defensive like, you know,
925 utt 4644.19 4648.18 -0.0717  oh, you're going to tell me how to live my life or whatever.
926 utt 4648.36 4654.52 -0.0909  There's no joy in being right about climate change or being a vegan or single-use plastic.
927 utt 4654.52 4657.89 -0.3217  You know, some of these things that we've been talking about for many years.
928 utt 4657.89 4663.35 -0.1613  But I would hope that people would be more open to these points of view now that there's
929 utt 4663.35 4666.56 -0.0339  been a great success rate about a lot of things we've been talking about.
930 utt 4666.56 4673.70 -0.0890  You know, right here in L.A. and in several other cities, solar power is now on a par with,
931 utt 4673.70 4677.31 -0.1301  you know, the traditional grid power of coal and natural gas and all of that.
932 utt 4677.31 4679.80 -0.0314  It's now cost-effective to do solar.
933 utt 4679.80 4682.21 -0.0326  So that's a big game changer.
934 utt 4682.21 4687.90 -0.0695  So now maybe people will be open to these kinds of things and dietary choices that you can make
935 utt 4687.90 4690.95 -0.0235  that will be good for the environment and good for your own health.
936 utt 4690.95 4695.13 -0.1211  When I use the term plant-based, I find people just open up.
937 utt 4695.13 4696.41 -0.9973  You can just, oh, yay.
938 utt 4696.41 4697.77 -0.3401  Yeah, I love plants.
939 utt 4697.77 4699.06 -0.2358  That's good, you know.
940 utt 4699.16 4705.08 -0.2310  And when I use the term vegan, oftentimes, I just see them kind of close up.
941 utt 4705.08 4708.53 -0.2209  So it's, hey, you know, I want to use what works.
942 utt 4708.53 4714.87 -0.2136  I mean, if people are going to be more open to the word plant-based or words plant-based
943 utt 4714.87 4718.56 -0.1997  as opposed to the word vegan, sure, I'll do it.
944 utt 4718.56 4719.68 -0.2575  As long as I eat my food.
945 utt 4719.68 4720.65 -1.4914  That's all I care about.
946 utt 4720.65 4722.09 -0.2230  I don't care how they get there.
947 utt 4722.09 4726.50 -0.0586  I just want them to get there and then understand what it's about.
948 utt 4726.50 4731.80 -0.2985  And then the discussion about veganism can hopefully come into play.
949 utt 4731.80 4733.24 -0.4275  I mean, baby steps, right?
950 utt 4733.91 4735.41 -0.0669  Whatever works.
951 utt 4736.40 4742.39 -0.1234  What do we do as activists that actually reaches people and that actually changes the world?
952 utt 4742.39 4744.64 -0.0800  You know, screaming is fun.
953 utt 4744.66 4750.42 -0.0150  Throwing fake blood is really satisfying, but it doesn't change the world.
954 utt 4750.42 4752.82 -0.4253  It doesn't make the world a better place for animals.
955 utt 4752.82 4756.76 -0.0108  It just satisfies our emotional need to scream and throw fake blood.
956 utt 4756.76 4768.55 -0.4058  You know, so in being a vegan activist and being an animal rights activist, the criteria by which my actions are judged is how effective am I at being an activist for animals?
957 utt 4768.55 4770.64 -0.2042  You know, not how much I enjoy it.
958 utt 4770.66 4774.25 -0.1480  Not how much I want to scream, because I just want to scream at everybody.
959 utt 4774.25 4778.66 -0.1237  But am I making the world a better place through my activism for the animals?
960 utt 4781.73 4784.04 -0.1224  My grandfather's a butcher.
961 utt 4784.04 4785.48 -1.2945  Grew up in Kansas.
962 utt 4785.83 4789.58 -0.7368  You know, meat-eating, meat-eating, meat-eating family.
963 utt 4789.58 4796.40 -0.0517  And here it was almost in the middle of the night, and I hear this wailing coming from the barn.
964 utt 4796.40 4802.82 -0.1387  It's pouring down rain and whatever, so I put on my big old rubber boots and go on down there.
965 utt 4802.92 4808.19 -0.2506  And storms happening outside, and it's cold, and it's dark, and it's...
966 utt 4808.19 4813.89 -0.0928  It was an experience like you can't imagine, unless you live through it, I think.
967 utt 4813.89 4819.27 -0.4363  You know, I mean, I've birthed my own babies, but I'm a little distracted.
968 utt 4819.27 4826.25 -0.0676  But here, I'm watching the miracle of life just happen right in front of me, and my hands are right there, and I'm in there,
969 utt 4826.25 4837.48 -0.5904  and I'm actually inside this lamb pulling out the baby, and it was just a really beautiful moment.
970 utt 4837.48 4867.10 -2.9401  It's just a really beautiful moment.
971 utt 4867.12 4873.60 -1.0928  I feel a connection like I would with a child of my own.
972 utt 4876.83 4891.41 -0.1186  You know, it changed me in my thoughts about food, especially to the day that she was killed.
973 utt 4891.83 4895.82 -0.0378  I wasn't home by design.
974 utt 4895.82 4897.59 -0.0043  I knew she was going to be.
975 utt 4898.17 4900.56 -0.1559  That was the plan from the beginning.
976 utt 4900.56 4902.08 -0.0396  That was our structure.
977 utt 4902.08 4903.53 -0.0490  That's what we did.
978 utt 4905.31 4909.47 -0.2339  And so, you know, it was tough that day.
979 utt 4910.61 4918.45 -0.2688  But my background has always been, you know, this is life.
980 utt 4918.45 4920.86 -0.4019  This is the way things are.
981 utt 4920.86 4921.74 -0.3043  And this is...
982 utt 4922.09 4924.47 -0.2146  So my feelings were wrong.
983 utt 4924.47 4927.04 -0.3499  You know, I needed to bucket up.
984 utt 4927.04 4937.31 -0.0358  I needed to get with the program and stop being so emotional about it and feed my family.
985 utt 4937.31 4940.12 -0.0357  And that was kind of the attitude of things.
986 utt 4940.12 4956.25 -0.2848  And so I cooked dinner a short time later using this baby and cried for days.
987 utt 4956.27 4957.13 -0.9250  It was...
988 utt 4957.13 4966.04 -1.1958  It was...
989 utt 4966.04 4966.60 -5.1395  It was...
990 utt 4966.60 4967.24 -2.5728  It...
991 utt 4967.24 4968.13 -2.3927  It was...
992 utt 4968.13 4968.77 -4.3782  It was...
993 utt 4968.77 4970.53 -1.9824  It was...
994 utt 4970.53 4971.26 -3.7852  It was...
995 utt 4971.26 4971.58 -8.3955  It was...
996 utt 4971.58 4972.46 -2.4531  It was...
997 utt 4972.46 4972.86 -7.2435  It was...
998 utt 4972.86 4973.18 -8.7676  It was...
999 utt 4973.18 4984.26 -0.3358  I'm resonating to the sound of the Spirit in the forest and the stream.
1000 utt 4986.20 4990.11 -0.1547  Vibrating to eternal rhythms
1001 utt 4991.90 4996.37 -0.0348  Where the mysteries unfold magically
1002 utt 4998.00 5001.59 -0.0832  Every year for Thanksgiving we do a celebration for the turkeys
1003 utt 5001.77 5003.76 -0.1650  Where the turkeys are the guests of honor
1004 utt 5004.18 5006.73 -0.2122  The turkeys dig in, they love pumpkin pie
1005 utt 5007.23 5010.18 -0.0427  And they stick their face right into it
1006 utt 5010.18 5012.10 -0.4665  And splatter it all around
1007 utt 5012.44 5016.76 -0.1099  There's a memory of another space and time
1008 utt 5016.78 5023.18 -0.7058  I'm on my way to soaring into the light
1009 utt 5024.72 5027.35 -0.2900  She said, Mom, I got the pig, I got the pig
1010 utt 5027.35 5028.15 -0.7598  Oh, good, good
1011 utt 5028.15 5031.04 -0.1733  And she says, and I named it Herman
1012 utt 5031.04 5032.08 -1.4238  I said, oh, you did not
1013 utt 5032.19 5033.69 -0.1631  After your dad
1014 utt 5034.03 5035.77 -0.3079  She said, I did too
1015 utt 5036.68 5038.66 -0.6846  I said, what's your pig?
1016 utt 5039.65 5041.71 -0.2575  Grace your heart, go forth
1017 utt 5042.30 5043.80 -0.0724  Share the mystery
1018 utt 5045.75 5048.37 -0.1018  The world's ready now for you
1019 utt 5049.04 5051.90 -0.0523  To do what you're here to do
1020 utt 5052.57 5055.35 -0.0140  The planetary signs are in line
1021 utt 5055.35 5057.68 -0.9474  Girl, you're right on time
1022 utt 5059.79 5061.61 -0.0382  Some children want to go vegan
1023 utt 5061.61 5064.18 -0.2402  But the mom and dad don't have enough courage to do it
1024 utt 5064.18 5066.75 -0.2877  So I'm very, very blessed and lucky to have them
1025 utt 5066.75 5071.81 -0.1257  And I think these are the best parents that a child can ask for
1026 utt 5073.11 5077.58 -0.2320  There's a memory of another space and time
1027 utt 5078.17 5084.16 -0.6222  I'm on my way to soaring into the light
1028 utt 5087.40 5091.06 -0.1622  I'm resonating to the sound
1029 utt 5093.17 5094.60 -0.0805  To the sound
1030 utt 5100.15 5120.35 -0.8826  To the sound
1031 utt 5120.94 5122.04 -0.1461  To the sound
1032 utt 5134.58 5136.65 -0.6311  The cage of chickens fell off a tree
1033 utt 5136.65 5142.34 -0.1631  transport into Memorial Park and broke open and all of them but one were killed.
1034 utt 5143.17 5147.96 -0.0669  One of them had one of her wings ripped off and was lying there mostly dead.
1035 utt 5154.72 5161.44 -0.1539  So I went and picked this chicken up and took her to the shelter, took her to our vets, took her to
1036 utt 5161.44 5167.30 -0.5538  an avian vet and she, we fostered her. We named her Isabelle and got to know her.
1037 utt 5169.09 5175.32 -0.2392  It became impossible to ignore that we had to take the next step and my partner and I had both had
1038 utt 5175.32 5182.39 -0.4870  brushes with being vegan. We've been vegetarian for years but this for us, Isabelle's face was on it.
1039 utt 5183.13 5184.39 -0.0811  To the sound
1040 utt 5189.55 5195.79 -0.5784  This isn't a question about eggs, this is a question about Isabelle and that's a really easy answer.
1041 utt 5197.73 5203.41 -0.9458  Aum Namah Shivaya
1042 utt 5225.98 5226.68 -2.0993  сторон
1043 utt 5245.88 5226.68 -10000000000.0000 
1044 utt 5245.88 5253.40 -0.0401  Could you look an animal in its face and simply say to it that your appetite is more important
1045 utt 5253.40 5254.85 -0.0159  than its suffering?
1046 utt 5254.85 5260.71 -0.2281  You know, that your desire to eat it is more important than its desire to be alive?
1047 utt 5263.54 5268.57 -0.3482  Houdini has fallen in love with Herman the Pig.
1048 utt 5268.57 5269.45 -0.4031  Oh yeah.
1049 utt 5269.48 5275.15 -0.1693  I was out there earlier, nobody else was around and they were just nose to nose.
1050 utt 5275.57 5281.25 -0.1846  And I watched them a little while and they just, I don't know what they were saying to
1051 utt 5281.25 5284.70 -0.1930  each other, but they were communicating.
1052 utt 5307.43 5326.75 -0.3939  Haha.
1053 utt 5326.75 5331.40 -0.0168  To have the experience of somebody that gets dragged to my truck by somebody else generally
1054 utt 5331.43 5337.82 -0.3675  that understands and then they try it and it's just so cool and then they always come to the window.
1055 utt 5337.82 5342.72 -0.2188  That's why we have the best customers because they're always coming to the window after they eat
1056 utt 5342.72 5346.49 -0.5280  saying thank you for being here, it was so good and things like that.
1057 utt 5346.91 5350.34 -0.5057  They're just very generous people, you know, it's nice.
1058 utt 5350.34 5379.31 -1.1212  Your question.
1059 utt 5379.31 5381.48 -5.7415  Let's leave your intact so that you can get the most valuable information
1060 utt 5381.48 5381.80 -8.9857  over there.
1061 utt 5381.80 5410.93 -1.6098  Let's leave your inside.
1062 utt 5410.93 5415.10 -0.1693  I'm 65 years of age and I ride my bike all over LA still.
1063 utt 5415.10 5419.52 -0.1658  I'm in great shape and I've been to my high school reunion and I can tell you it's better
1064 utt 5419.52 5420.88 -0.1296  to be a vegan.
