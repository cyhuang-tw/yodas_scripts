6 42.68 48.16  Two months ago, I was going to put the chickens up like I do every night, and they all come
7 48.16 54.48  running and following me, and she was just down, and she wouldn't get up. And I thought,
8 54.48 60.8  well, that's weird. And so I went over and just gently walked over to her and said,
9 60.8 66.0  can you get up? And she just looked at me and did that. And she couldn't get up. And I tried,
10 66.0 69.03999999999999  picked her up, and I just tried to set her down gently, and she just collapsed.
11 70.4 77.44  And so evidently, she injured her tendon or a muscle, a pool of muscle. I'm not sure what she did,
12 77.44 84.16  but I brought her in the house, and she stayed in Tommy's office for a couple of days, and I fed her,
13 84.8 93.44  you know, oatmeal. And there's a, I take this stuff called zeal, and it's got turmeric in it, and
14 95.28 101.52  you know, ashwagandha. It's got all these wonderful herbs and stuff in it, and foods.
15 102.32 106.72  And so I thought, well, it's good for me. It helps my inflammation, so I give it to the chicken. So I
16 107.67999999999999 114.72  started giving her the zeal in little syringes two or three times a day. And she started getting better,
17 114.72 123.03999999999999  and a lot of TLC. And the next thing you know, well, hey, that's Dixie. You know Dixie.
18 125.36 130.8  But the next thing you know, the, she was, she was walking better, even though she was kind of like
19 130.8 134.72  hop-along. I called her a hop-along Cassidy kid, because she still kind of hop along, but she was
20 134.72 139.44  doing just fine. And then a couple days ago, she was down again. I went to put them up in the chicken
21 139.44 147.84  coop, and she was sitting down right there at the edge of the coop. Before I went vegan,
22 149.35999999999999 153.92  I loved Chick-fil-A sandwiches, you know, chicken sandwiches. I mean, as much as anybody. And
23 153.92 161.2  I would come home and with a sandwich, a chicken sandwich, and I'd have my chickens at my feet. And
24 162.88 172.48  not everybody gets the tactile, you know, experience of living on a ranch like this going vegan. You know,
25 174.72 182.32  I started having all these conflicts in my mind and my soul that I would be eating a chicken and
26 182.32 186.95999999999998  loving this one, you know. And we never ate our own animals. Even the cows, we never slaughtered our own
27 186.95999999999998 191.04  cows. We always bought the pretty pink packages, you know, at the grocery store.
28 194.0 202.24  And she's going to sleep. And I remember vividly when I was working on her leg in the kitchen and
29 202.24 210.56  giving her a little syringe of that, that zeal. I remember vividly that I was working on her and I
30 210.56 217.28  got the gut feeling of how I used to eat chicken legs when I was working on her leg. And I just started
31 217.28 227.68  crying at the sink. Just started crying. I mean, I was deep, guttural, horrifying, just sobs. Because I was
32 227.68 234.88  working on her leg and realizing that, you know, everybody eats them. Never even thinks a thing about it.
33 240.56 244.56  I was working on her leg. I was working on her leg. And I was working on her leg. And I was tired.
34 245.28 250.4  And he goes, Hey, come out here. There's this girl that wants to meet you. And I said, Yeah, you're lying.
35 251.44 260.24  You always are. And he was. And I went anyway. And anyway, I met her. Yeah, Renee's an incredible person.
36 260.24 270.24  She's always done incredible stuff. One of the early things I saw was she was in a play in Houston,
37 270.24 277.2  two or 3000 people, you know, threw the roses on the stage and all that stuff because she was the main
38 277.2 284.8  singer. And she was right on the edge of making it. And it was a wild ride. You could write a book about
39 284.8 297.44  her music career. And for whatever reason, it never happened. Oh, Shenandoah, I long to see you.
40 297.44 312.48  Oh, Shenandoah, I long to see you.
41 314.4 320.56  Across the wild Missouri.
42 320.56 328.88  Herman's very soothed about music. And so I sing to him all the time.
43 331.04 339.68  And I see his eyes change when I sing to him and I watch his ears perk up. I watch the hair go down on
44 339.68 350.24  his back. You know, he he was on a concrete floor at that kill shelter. It was not nice.
45 350.24 356.96000000000004  He had barking dogs all around him. And so he was very stressed when we got him.
46 358.64 359.04  Very.
47 361.2 364.88  Right over there, we're building his fences and his home.
48 364.88 368.8  His little feet are going to touch the earth for the first time in a long time.
49 370.0 372.4  Got to get him out of here. I want him out of here so bad.
50 375.2 380.32  Herman's owner had passed away. He had been left for six months. The kids came and cleared out the
51 380.32 384.88  house, cleared out the furniture, got the dog in the cap and left the pig. And Herman had been fending
52 384.88 389.36  for himself. So the animal control officers had picked him up, brought him into the shelter.
53 389.36 396.8  And Renee, God love her, she's a week out from this event. She has spent all the money she's got
54 396.8 402.56  on this project. Her husband, at the time we talked on the phone, her husband was out in the midday sun
55 402.56 410.8  mowing and shoring up fences to contain the bull calves that didn't go to slaughter. And she said,
56 410.8 416.0  I don't know, Sleese, I don't know if I can, a pig. I've never dealt with a pig. I don't even have a place
57 416.0 424.48  to put him. I don't know. When that big storm came through, everybody lost fence. Lots of Lake Jackson,
58 424.48 431.52  lots of Danbury. So we got tons of calls and then she called me with this. I couldn't tell her no.
59 432.56 438.32  And I think we exchanged 40 or maybe 50,000 emails about how we were going to get this done. And who
60 438.32 441.12  was going to hold him, who was going to pick him up, what were we going to feed him, how are we going
61 441.12 445.04  to lure him, who was going to house him, how are we going to get his pen built, how are we going to raise
62 445.04 452.08000000000004  the money to build the pen. And it was just like this beehive of activity. And I came to have this
63 452.08000000000004 456.56  enormous respect for Renee because she really is a, she would just get it done.
64 456.56 462.24  The way I look at it is comes around, goes around. You do something good,
65 463.76 468.0  somebody returns the favor eventually. So I always try to help out.
66 468.0 479.36  Renee does the same. When she started talking about sanctuary, I didn't tell her, but
67 480.32 488.48  I was thinking, I guess I'm going to get a divorce because this is ridiculous. It's not going to work
68 488.48 501.76  in Texas. And she wanted to try it. And Renee is a very strong willed person. And you can't tell her
69 501.76 507.52000000000004  not to do something. I wasn't trying to, you know, open up a sanctuary in the state of Texas. That's not
70 507.52000000000004 513.04  been my goal in life. My goal was to be a famous country and western singer. Hello. That's what I
71 513.04 518.9599999999999  thought I was going to be one day, you know, and, and that didn't happen. And I married a farmer.
72 518.9599999999999 524.56  He's worked hard all his life. He bought this place to supplement his retirement. We hadn't been
73 524.56 530.0  making any money. Balloon notes were coming due on tractors. He's needing to buy another rake. And
74 530.0 535.1999999999999  now I'm telling him, oh, heck no, you ain't taking that red trailer up the road anymore. We're not selling
75 535.1999999999999 540.16  any more calves. You send that red trailer up the road one more time. I'm following it. I'll go to the
76 540.16 545.6  slaughterhouse if I have to. And it was a process for me because I mean, I love my husband. I didn't
77 545.6 551.6  want to just say, you know, too bad. You go up the road. What I've been here is a catalyst for my
78 551.6 560.3199999999999  husband to see a way that he's never been shown before because his history, his culture, his way of
79 560.3199999999999 568.24  viewing the world is so grounded in tradition. Fourth generation cattle rancher, his great grandpa
80 568.24 578.0  herded cows from San Antonio, by horse, whispers, and they had their own brand. And Tommy still has that.
81 578.0 584.48  That means something to him to restore that history. So this is Tommy's heritage. For Tommy to say,
82 585.2 593.84  um, you know, none of that meant anything is, doesn't come easy. But watching his wife change,
83 593.84 600.0  watching his wife draw the line in the sand, watching his wife pull in all these people from
84 600.0 606.4  around the world that are supporting us to, to build a sanctuary in the state of Texas is changing my
85 606.4 615.76  husband. That's what's changing my husband. I kind of laughed at her and said it'll never work. And
86 615.76 626.24  she has actually put me in my place now because the vegan world came to her rescue. I mean, she started
87 626.24 633.52  meeting people that allied with her. It was incredible. And I started watching it and I
88 633.52 640.64  couldn't believe what was going on. Uh, I still, it's kind of like a dream. Uh, they're incredible.
89 640.64 648.96  Uh, if she has a problem, somebody in her network helps her out and it magically disappears.
90 648.96 658.72  I think that we all have the power to change and to transform. And we see that every single day
91 658.72 665.92  at Mercy for Animals. Someone whose family owned a cattle ranch decides to give up everything that
92 665.92 672.8  they knew to be familiar to become a vegan animal rights activist. We see every single day the power
93 672.8 681.92  that compassion has. Is it not better to light a candle than to curse the darkness? All the darkness
94 681.92 689.5999999999999  in the world cannot put out the light of a single candle. I believe another world is possible.
95 689.6 700.08  And on a quiet night, I can hear her breathing. It will be difficult. I know, but do not be afraid.
96 701.28 709.0400000000001  Remember Mahatma Gandhi's words. First, they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you.
97 709.04 719.92  And then you win. The brutes and the bullies have been Goliath. But David is coming. Maybe he's in this room.
98 721.76 730.4  Maybe he's one of you. And if not you, who? And if not now, when?
99 730.4 738.0799999999999  I'm a woman. Here's my daughter, Genesis Bowman. Thank you.
100 746.56 753.4399999999999  Hi, my name is Genesis and I'm eight years old. I am vegan and an activist. Like my uncle Cesar
101 753.4399999999999 759.1999999999999  Travis was. I am vegan because I don't believe animals should be put in slaughterhouses and circuses.
102 759.2 764.24  People don't have to eat animals to live. All my favorite foods like pizza and mac and cheese,
103 764.24 766.4000000000001  I can still eat. And a vegan version.
104 770.24 774.6400000000001  I became an activist to protest for what's right to show kids they have a voice.
105 775.2 780.88  I protest circuses and other places that imprison animals. I help people who are blinded.
106 780.88 786.96  They don't know what's happening to the animals. I also leave to give information on what's happening
107 786.96 793.2800000000001  and now to go vegan. I even talk to my friends. My goal is to get them to go vegan. I'm here for a
108 793.2800000000001 799.2800000000001  purpose. My purpose is to get the whole world to go vegan. Thank you for helping me. Peace.
109 799.28 806.0  Oh my God.
110 806.0 814.0799999999999  She wasn't even four years old. She always had chicken nuggets. That was her favorite meal at the time.
111 814.56 819.28  And so I read all the parenting books in the world because it was my first child. And a lot of books
112 819.28 824.0  said if that's all they want to eat and they're picky, just let them eat chicken nuggets or whatever
113 824.0 829.2  it is all day. And I just said, okay, well, I believe the commercials, the white meat and, you know,
114 829.2 834.32  if you have milk with it or apples and the whole kids' meals and all that. And I would give it to
115 834.32 838.4  her because it made her happy. And at least I thought it made her happy because I believe the
116 838.4 843.28  advertisements and it didn't make her happy. And she just finally told me one day, she said,
117 843.28 847.84  hey, mom, where do we get our food from? And I said, you know, we get it from the grocery store.
118 847.84 853.12  And she said, no, that's not where we get it from. And she, she knew. And so I just,
119 853.12 858.0  at that moment I knew I had a tough decision to make. Do I tell her the truth or do I just,
120 858.0 862.24  you know, keep playing it off? And just my instincts came kicked in and I said, I'm going to tell her
121 862.24 866.96  the truth because I always told myself as a parent, if my child asks me something,
122 866.96 870.4  I'm going to give them the straight truth because, you know, that's what's needed.
123 870.4 876.0  And I told her we kill animals for the food that she was eating. And she was devastated.
124 876.0 880.96  And I didn't even know she knew what death meant at that age. And she just knew deep down inside.
125 880.96 886.24  And she said, well, we have to kill. What is it? I said, well, chickens and cows. And I was explaining,
126 886.24 891.2800000000001  you know, beef is from cows, like the burger. That's not beef. That's a cow. And you know,
127 891.2800000000001 894.88  the chicken is the actual animal, the little bird. And she said, you know what,
128 894.88 896.48  I don't ever want to eat this again.
129 901.6 904.96  One of the great things, but the maddening things about being an animal rights activist
130 904.96 910.96  is for the most part, we never have to convince people to care about animals. People already love
131 910.96 919.6800000000001  animals. We just have to convince people to understand that the dog they love is emotionally
132 919.6800000000001 926.48  the same as the cow they eat. You know, that's the disconnect. So it's aligning people's already
133 926.48 931.52  existing love for animals with their actions. And so I look at someone like Genesis and to me,
134 931.52 938.72  she just seems like she's, she's living her beliefs in a way that most people don't.
135 939.92 945.76  You know, I mean, how many parents have had the experience with their kid where like their four
136 945.76 950.0799999999999  year old, their six year old, their eight year old, their nine year old is eating a hamburger and says,
137 950.0799999999999 955.92  mom, what is this? And the mom says, that's a hamburger. Well, where does it come from? A cow. And
138 955.92 963.1999999999999  all of a sudden the child's horrified and the child almost has to like be taught to move past their
139 963.1999999999999 969.04  horror. And one of our jobs is to remind them that no, their horror was justified. You know,
140 969.04 973.5999999999999  the eight year old who's horrified at eating a hamburger, that's a legitimate response. It's a
141 973.5999999999999 980.16  justified response. The 18 year old, the 28 year old who eats the hamburger as if there's no consequences
142 980.16 987.28  for the environment for them or for animals. That's the mistake. This is my bunny. Her name's Charlotte.
143 987.28 997.1999999999999  And my, my mom's friend and my friend named Nina gave it to me. And this is very special to me because
144 997.92 1005.6  it only has one foot and I'm on a mission to find its other foot. Somebody has it. And I just
145 1006.32 1011.0400000000001  have to find its foot because like, I don't think it's right just to have one foot.
146 1012.64 1019.44  She told me about how the, the bunny, it wasn't like a natural bunny. It had been like ran through
147 1019.44 1025.2  the mill, but she really was interested in it. And then when she brought it home and showed me it,
148 1025.2 1033.44  and it was, it's kind of ugly, but, but it has character that it made sense to me, um, as far as
149 1033.44 1038.96  with animals go, that not all of them look the same, but they all need love in their own way.
150 1038.96 1044.96  You know, she's just a sweet girl. Just a sweet girl. Yeah.
151 1044.96 1050.96  I don't feel that I shouldn't love her just because she has one foot. All animals should be loved.
152 1050.96 1057.52  They shouldn't be tortured. Charlotte is awesome because each time I'm crying or sad,
153 1057.52 1061.36  she's always there for me. And if I need a pal, she'll be there.
154 1066.48 1070.72  One day I was nursing my baby and she came and she looked at her sister when I was nursing and she
155 1070.72 1077.28  said, mom, where do we get milk? And I said, oh man, I'm going vegan today. I already knew it was,
156 1077.28 1082.24  it was going to happen. It was a wrap. So we went vegan that day. From that point on,
157 1082.24 1087.1200000000001  we never looked back. But I did look back a couple of times for a chocolate bar and she caught me.
158 1087.1200000000001 1092.08  So, so when she caught me with the chocolate bar, she said, mom, she put her hand on her hip. I said,
159 1092.08 1096.88  uh oh, I'm about to get lectured. She said, if you can't handle it, I can't. Don't think you have
160 1096.88 1099.76  to go vegan just cause I am. She goes, I can do it on my own.
161 1112.24 1125.28  Don't ever underestimate your own voice. When you speak with kindness and sincerity, people will
162 1125.28 1131.28  listen. And every single leaflet that Genesis or I hand out has a potential to change one person's
163 1131.28 1136.56  life forever. So don't ever forget, we just got to plant as many seeds as humanly possible. Some of
164 1136.56 1140.0  them will grow, some of them will not, but we just got to, you know, keep fighting, keep being out there,
165 1140.0 1144.4  keep educating the masses. You cannot get the truth from a corporation. We have to hit the streets,
166 1144.4 1150.24  provide this information and people will respond to this message of kindness. So if she can get this,
167 1150.24 1155.12  how can adults not get it? And that's why I'm so inspired by her. On her first day of school,
168 1155.12 1159.52  she wore a love animals, don't eat them t-shirt. And her mother asked her after the first day of school,
169 1159.52 1164.72  did they, did kids make fun of you or say anything during lunch? And Genesis says, yeah. And her mom's like,
170 1164.72 1168.96  well, what did they do? She's like, oh, well, they waved hot dogs in my face. They rubbed salami on my cheeks.
171 1168.96 1175.8400000000001  And her mom is like, well, did you cry? And Genesis is like, yeah, I cried. And then her mom's like,
172 1175.8400000000001 1179.8400000000001  did you cry because they were making fun of you? And Genesis is like, oh, no, I cried because they
173 1179.8400000000001 1185.2  didn't understand that they're hurting animals. The average person eats about 7,000 animals in their
174 1185.2 1190.88  lifetime, if you include fish. So just spending 10 minutes handing out those 100 leaflets, that's going
175 1190.88 1195.28  to save over the course of time thousands of animals from a life of horror we couldn't even begin to
176 1195.28 1199.2  imagine. But every day we go out and leave a hand out a few thousand leaflets. We're getting tons of
177 1199.2 1203.28  people to go vegan, others to go vegetarian, getting people to be aware of these issues,
178 1203.28 1207.84  a first step. That's why the first step of any revolution is education. And that's what me and
179 1207.84 1214.3999999999999  Genesis do all the time. At first, I wasn't really for it just because I know some some adults can be
180 1214.4 1223.76  very rude to children and adults, vice versa. But as she did it and her mom's where I think
181 1224.96 1232.4  it's hard to be mean to a child like that. I just kind of have a trust that they kind of see like a
182 1232.4 1238.0  light in her that maybe it might happen to other people, but I just don't think it would happen to
183 1238.0 1245.68  her. Otherwise, I wouldn't have her do it. It's just that she has she's so um it she opens up people.
184 1245.68 1251.6  She makes people feel comfortable. So even the person that planned on being mean or usually is rude,
185 1251.6 1257.12  they it's a weird thing that they're nice to her. She's just just like her name, the beginning,
186 1257.12 1263.84  just Genesis. She's something new, something that we haven't seen before. It's just you don't see the
187 1263.84 1271.28  stuff that she does. I've never seen kids do those things. So I'm comfortable with it. Yeah, I'm
188 1271.28 1276.8799999999999  comfortable with it. When kids are young, they say, I want to be so and so when I get older. Well,
189 1276.8799999999999 1282.32  I want to be Genesis when I get older because because just her spirit and her compassion and
190 1282.32 1287.1999999999998  to wake up every day and see her here at my house, it's just awesome. And to see how it spreads out to
191 1287.1999999999998 1292.24  the whole family. Everybody, you know, has a lot of compassion for animals, for other humans, for
192 1292.24 1297.52  homeless. Like we'll even see homeless people and my little boy will cry if we can't give him a dollar.
193 1297.52 1301.76  And you know, it's all started with Genesis just reminding us that we need to be a little more
194 1301.76 1307.36  compassionate, not just to other humans or to our family members, but to everyone else in the world,
195 1307.36 1314.48  including animals. Children have a natural connection with other animals. And then as time goes, we become
196 1314.48 1321.2  acculturated to accept certain things that don't feel right. We come to believe that it's okay for
197 1321.2 1329.52  cruelty to become normal. And we become adulterated in a sense, instead of following our instincts and
198 1329.52 1337.8400000000001  our humane intuition and our natural empathy. And so I think holding onto that childhood perspective
199 1337.8400000000001 1343.68  and connection with animals and nature is very valuable. And it's a beautiful thing when children
200 1343.68 1347.28  who are young and hold onto that continue with it throughout their life.
201 1361.2 1368.64  I knew that something wasn't right. I knew that I wasn't drinking like other people. I was passing out,
202 1368.64 1375.92  getting alcohol poisoning, blacking out, getting sick, drinking before school, things that normal
203 1375.92 1382.96  10th graders don't quite do. I had a lot of trauma in my life. And I think that's a common thread with
204 1382.96 1392.64  people that develop some substance abuse problems. The divorce and not having a present father and
205 1392.64 1401.1200000000001  our family was ripped apart. Alcohol, that was the elixir that helped kind of make things feel a little
206 1401.1200000000001 1408.5600000000002  bit better. I would go into 7-elevens and stores like that and literally steal the alcohol from the
207 1408.5600000000002 1414.64  coolers, put it down my pants, and then go drink the alcohol by myself behind the building. After high
208 1414.64 1420.64  school, I started taking trips to South Florida, Miami, South Beach more, and I started getting into
209 1421.2 1423.68  heavier drugs on a regular basis.
210 1436.3200000000002 1444.3200000000002  After that year or so, I started getting more into cocaine. And by the time I was 25,
211 1444.32 1452.8  I was a daily drinker and user and cigarette smoker and very unhealthy. And I honestly should not be
212 1452.8 1461.12  here right now. I should be dead. I did almost overdose many times. I've been in nasty car accidents
213 1461.12 1464.96  where the people have come to the scene of the accident and they've seen the vehicle and they said,
214 1464.96 1471.8400000000001  you don't need to go to the hospital. I've committed felonies that I've gotten away with
215 1472.72 1479.92  plenty of times. I just acted, you know, very immorally and very recklessly. And, you know,
216 1479.92 1484.48  I just didn't care. I didn't care. It was almost like it was a cry for help. It was just like,
217 1485.52 1486.0  saved me.
218 1486.0 1500.48  I called my brother and I called him in the middle of the night and I was crying to him on the phone.
219 1500.48 1507.44  And I apparently I said that I needed help. I still to this day don't recall that, but that's what
220 1507.44 1514.48  he said. And I believe him, love my brother to death. And so I went to go visit and
221 1515.76 1519.84  my sister was there, my brother was there, my sister-in-law was there, my mother was there,
222 1519.84 1523.52  and my little niece was there. And we were sitting around and talking and
223 1523.52 1530.56  and then all of a sudden the tone kind of changed a little bit. And, and I think it was my mom who said,
224 1530.56 1536.24  you know, well, the real reason we wanted to all get together today and talk to you is we wanted to
225 1536.8 1543.28  talk to you about your, your problem that you have. And so I was there with all my loved ones and
226 1544.8 1549.44  they all went around the room and they told me how I've affected them, which I didn't think I did.
227 1549.44 1553.36  I thought I'm only affecting myself. This is my life. Let me do what I want. You do what
228 1553.36 1561.04  you want. I didn't realize that's the selfishness and self centeredness of, of, um, this affliction.
229 1561.04 1567.1999999999998  So they all went around and told me and I was blown away and they said, we'll help you if you help
230 1567.1999999999998 1576.8799999999999  yourself. So I checked myself into a, uh, 28 day rehab, you know, like they say, uh, a huge tree can grow
231 1576.88 1582.88  from a tiny mustard seed. And that's, that's where I began.
232 1585.3600000000001 1592.0  People want to ask me so many questions about ultra running or being vegan or, or this and that.
233 1592.0 1598.96  It's like, it's really simple. It's just simple, you know, it's, uh, just about the love really.
234 1598.96 1601.28  And that's, that's really the void that was filled.
235 1605.28 1606.24  Good job, buddy.
236 1606.24 1609.52  Oh, wow.
237 1609.52 1611.44  That was such a huge part.
238 1611.44 1613.3600000000001  Yeah.
239 1613.3600000000001 1614.24  Hey, Goosey.
240 1614.24 1615.04  Good job.
241 1615.04 1616.64  How are you?
242 1616.64 1623.28  It was such a nice surprise to see him come up to me. His whole body was, it wasn't just like his tail
243 1623.28 1628.72  was wagging. It was like his whole body was just wiggling back and forth and, oh, it just really
244 1628.72 1635.68  warmed my heart. The, the relationship between dogs and humans is quite profound.
245 1636.8799999999999 1645.6  I didn't have the responsibility to have my own pets in the past. So the time was right now to get a dog
246 1645.6 1652.9599999999998  and to be a vegan, you realize more and more how much animals have been used as commodities.
247 1653.6 1660.1599999999999  We don't need to use them for money. Realizing that this animal has such feelings and such love.
248 1661.28 1664.32  You think just dogs are like that or other animals too?
249 1665.84 1672.9599999999998  Are cows like that or pigs like that, you know? So that was, uh, quite a shift for me.
250 1675.6 1677.6  So, we're going to go to the park.
251 1678.3999999999999 1679.6  Hey, Goosey.
252 1679.6 1680.3999999999999  How's it going?
253 1680.3999999999999 1681.1999999999998  Good. How are you?
254 1681.1999999999998 1682.6399999999999  Yeah, good. How was the race?
255 1682.6399999999999 1685.28  Oh, it was really fun, but it was tough.
256 1685.28 1686.32  I'm sure you killed it.
257 1687.52 1689.52  I'm looking forward to a float, definitely.
258 1689.52 1690.48  Yeah. Awesome.
259 1690.48 1693.12  The tank is all ready. You're in Floaterium. You can head on up.
260 1693.12 1694.1599999999999  Sweet. Thank you.
261 1694.1599999999999 1694.7199999999998  You're welcome.
262 1694.7199999999998 1695.4399999999998  See you in a bit.
263 1695.4399999999998 1696.1599999999999  See ya.
264 1705.6 1710.9599999999998  Bye-bye
265 1728.48 1730.6399999999999  new
266 1730.64 1733.2 好評
267 1736.3200000000002 1738.3200000000002  subtitles
268 1744.96 1746.96  OK
269 1748.0800000000002 1750.0800000000002  Oh
270 1757.3600000000001 1759.3600000000001  Oh
271 1760.64 1766.96  Ever since I jumped in the cab of that truck and started driving it, it's actually pretty
272 1766.96 1767.96  cool.
273 1767.96 1771.1200000000001  I feel pretty badass.
274 1771.1200000000001 1775.3200000000002  It's a very big truck and it's very heavy as well, so it's not just the size of it,
275 1775.3200000000002 1782.0400000000002  but to break takes a while because it's like 13,000 pounds.
276 1782.0400000000002 1788.0200000000002  It's kind of cool getting up there and driving this big old truck.
277 1788.02 1791.58  We live in the wine country, so this is our bread and butter around here.
278 1791.58 1792.58  There's so many wineries.
279 1792.58 1794.7  I don't think anyone's ever physically counted them.
280 1794.7 1797.12  There's too many to count.
281 1797.12 1801.44  When you're looking at that big of a presence with wineries, it's just important to utilize
282 1801.44 1802.44  the resource there.
283 1802.44 1803.44  I mean, why not?
284 1803.44 1805.4  This stuff is really good.
285 1805.4 1809.76  The best thing for me, and that's why I change up my menu all the time, is to just get in
286 1809.76 1813.62  the kitchen and say, I wonder what this would be like if I added this to it.
287 1813.62 1820.58  This whole rap that vegan food has had about being tasteless, it's just a bad rap.
288 1820.58 1822.86  People say to me all the time, oh, I've had vegan food.
289 1822.86 1823.86  It's not very good.
290 1823.86 1825.76  I'm like, yeah, me too.
291 1825.76 1827.3799999999999  I've had bad vegan food too.
292 1827.3799999999999 1829.54  I've had bad pizza.
293 1829.54 1832.02  If you care, I think, that the food is good.
294 1832.02 1836.62  I really care that not only the food is good, that it's knee buckling, that it's exceptional,
295 1836.62 1843.4399999999998  you know, if I'm making something, I'll taste it and like, yeah, this is really good, but
296 1843.4399999999998 1844.4399999999998  my knees aren't buckling yet.
297 1844.4399999999998 1846.9399999999998  I need something to go, ah, yes.
298 1846.9399999999998 1853.4399999999998  I think that people just need to come out and try it.
299 1853.4399999999998 1857.6999999999998  The word vegan, they think fake, and it's not.
300 1857.7 1861.92  And the taste is just out of this world.
301 1861.92 1866.5800000000002  And a lot of people say, you know, once they eat it, they're like, I don't even need to
302 1866.5800000000002 1872.06  go out and have, you know, that hamburger from that place after I've eaten her food.
303 1872.06 1878.56  So you just need to get over the idea that it's a fake food because it's not.
304 1878.56 1882.76  And I would say too that a lot of people have this impression that, oh, she's a vegan or he's
305 1882.76 1883.76  a vegan.
306 1883.76 1884.76  They eat carrots, right?
307 1884.76 1885.76  Or they eat a celery.
308 1885.76 1889.54  No, food, real and good food.
309 1889.54 1893.74  And you don't have to be vegan to come out and try vegan food.
310 1893.74 1901.14  I noticed this older gentleman with his veteran's hat and all these pins and looking a little
311 1901.14 1905.66  out of place, a little uneasy, you know, with, I'm not sure I recognize half the food on the
312 1905.66 1906.66  menu.
313 1906.66 1907.66  What is this?
314 1907.66 1910.16  I'm not, you know, a little unease, a little unease there.
315 1910.16 1913.74  I know you told me not to tell dad that it was vegan.
316 1913.74 1915.52  I met the daughter, urging him on.
317 1915.52 1917.52  Usually you've got a partner in crime there.
318 1917.52 1920.3  No, I have never tried vegan food before.
319 1920.3 1921.3  Thank you.
320 1921.3 1922.3  Enjoy.
321 1922.3 1925.5  I have a general idea.
322 1925.5 1929.52  It's non-meat, basically.
323 1929.52 1953.04  It's pretty good.
324 1953.04 1963.26  And she was really worried today for me coming here about vegan and told me to eat something
325 1963.26 1965.26  at home.
326 1965.26 1966.82  Well, I didn't.
327 1966.82 1971.6  And I thought, you've got to have something.
328 1971.6 1972.6  And I'm quite surprised.
329 1972.6 1974.54  It was very good.
330 1974.54 1975.54  It is very good.
331 1975.54 1976.54  I will finish it.
332 1976.54 1981.82  I could use a napkin.
333 1981.82 1984.76  And I was like, in the evening when I go by and I'm just walking by their table really
334 1984.76 1988.54  quick and the daughter grabs my arm and pulls me over to the table and she's like, I've
335 1988.54 1992.9399999999998  got to tell you, he's never had vegan food before and he loved it.
336 1992.9399999999998 2000.4199999999998  And I was like, it makes my heart proud because now vegan food is accessible, you know?
337 2000.42 2020.46  It's not a weird out there thing.
338 2020.46 2025.72  As far as being an animal lover, it was nothing that at the time when we first met that it
339 2025.72 2029.8600000000001  was anything that was out there.
340 2029.8600000000001 2034.6200000000001  But now that she has a vegan food truck, she does a lot of events for the SPCA and other
341 2034.6200000000001 2038.78  organizations like that and donates to their cause.
342 2038.78 2040.78  That's my favorite piece.
343 2040.78 2041.78  Yes, I know.
344 2041.78 2042.78  What would you have?
345 2042.78 2048.08  My wife's a vegan, so that means no leather products, no leather shoes, no leather belts,
346 2048.08 2053.06  no leather handbags, nothing that's derived from animals whatsoever.
347 2053.06 2060.96  And at first when she brought this up, especially being a vegan, because of my ignorance of diet
348 2060.96 2064.68  at the time, you're thinking, okay, where are you getting your protein?
349 2064.68 2065.98  Where are you getting your calcium?
350 2065.98 2069.14  Where are you getting all these vitamins and things like that?
351 2069.14 2074.06  And it turns out nature in the plant form provides all that stuff.
352 2074.06 2077.92  You just have to eat a well-balanced diet.
353 2077.92 2080.2799999999997  If you're wondering about, am I going to get enough protein?
354 2080.28 2085.1400000000003  Go out to the nearest rural area, pick the biggest bull you can find.
355 2085.1400000000003 2089.5600000000004  Or go to a racetrack, find the biggest, strongest stallion you can see.
356 2089.5600000000004 2093.38  Go to the zoo, look for the tallest giraffe, the biggest elephant.
357 2093.38 2098.6000000000004  All of those animals got those rippling muscles entirely from plant foods.
358 2098.6000000000004 2099.84  Those are vegans.
359 2099.84 2102.3  So yeah, you know, now a pussycat is a meat eater.
360 2102.3 2105.7000000000003  So it's not like eating a lot of meat is going to make you big.
361 2105.7 2109.04  You get plenty of protein from plants.
362 2109.04 2116.04  Research is now clearly showing that a plant-based diet beats every other diet.
363 2116.04 2120.7  And the federal policymakers are taking notice of that.
364 2120.7 2124.56  If Jerry's cooking a plant-based diet, I have no problem with that.
365 2124.56 2131.1  Ten years ago, I would have gone out to the store and bought some meat to add on to it,
366 2131.1 2132.46  but not anymore.
367 2132.46 2137.62  Now that I'm starting to understand that you can get all these nutrients, you can get the
368 2137.62 2146.56  protein, you can get everything you need from a plant-based diet, then the fears go away.
369 2146.56 2153.38  The dietary guidelines for Americans are reformulated every five years to be the blueprint for what
370 2153.38 2154.72  you're supposed to eat.
371 2154.72 2160.82  That means every kid in school, every food assistance program, really every nutrition program is
372 2160.82 2165.02  supposed to adhere to the dietary guidelines for Americans.
373 2165.02 2167.1  They're a big deal.
374 2167.1 2172.88  In the year 2000, we sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture because we found that six of the
375 2172.88 2179.02  11 members on the committee had financial ties to the meat industry, the milk industry, the
376 2179.02 2180.46  egg industry.
377 2180.46 2181.7000000000003  We won that lawsuit.
378 2181.7000000000003 2184.2000000000003  That opened up the process dramatically.
379 2184.2000000000003 2187.44  And ever since then, the guidelines have gotten better and better and better.
380 2187.44 2193.54  To run a business, you can't be sitting on your butt all day being tired.
381 2193.54 2196.42  So you have to have a balanced diet.
382 2196.42 2202.7000000000003  And I think by her being a vegan, by having a plant-based diet, her energy levels are higher.
383 2202.7 2204.3399999999997  Since then, you may have to have an effective diet.
384 2204.3399999999997 2229.16  During the year teal Gemeentes and E beads persons are paid off the 조
385 2229.16 2257.8799999999997  I'm amazed
386 2257.88 2262.7000000000003  Renee, she puts her mind on something and she goes for it.
387 2263.1 2267.28  Since she started this, I haven't got to visit very much because she's been so overwhelmed.
388 2267.88 2271.5  But I've been following her on Facebook and it's been very interesting.
389 2271.5 2274.46  I think I'm impressed.
390 2276.0 2278.1  Good for her. That's wonderful.
391 2278.32 2281.58  You know why? I can't claim to be a vegan by any means,
392 2281.7400000000002 2286.6600000000003  but she has inspired me to change my way of looking at things.
393 2286.66 2290.62  And she has opened my eyes to some things that I did not know existed.
394 2292.7999999999997 2296.04  They were trained gentle with kindness. They have no fear.
395 2296.64 2300.96  You know, a lot of people go to their pasture for a horse and they run the other way.
396 2302.54 2306.48  They don't want you to be around them. These guys, they're okay with it.
397 2307.2599999999998 2309.7  They're family, most definitely. Most definitely.
398 2309.7 2314.74  I've had him 23 years and he'll die on my property.
399 2315.3999999999996 2321.12  I mean, he'll be here until he grows old and sees his last day, won't you?
400 2321.66 2321.98  Yes.
401 2322.5 2326.3599999999997  He was an accident. He wasn't on purpose, but we love him just the same.
402 2326.36 2333.88  Here we go, Herman.
403 2333.88 2356.52  We heard about what Renee was doing out here for these animals.
404 2356.52 2360.06  And when the opportunity came up, I knew she had all this going on.
405 2360.56 2363.48  It was kind of a time crunch, but I felt like I had to be a part of it, really.
406 2364.08 2365.28  She's doing a good thing out here.
407 2365.58 2368.22  You know, and anytime that you get an opportunity to do something like this,
408 2368.32 2369.74  it's, you know, I try to jump on it.
409 2370.02 2370.64  Okay, Herman.
410 2370.64 2376.9  Yeah, I'm sure we're probably going to hang around to watch.
411 2377.24 2380.2999999999997  Yeah, we've put a lot of time and effort into this and this is going to be his home
412 2380.2999999999997 2382.56  and it'll make us feel really good to see him happy in it.
413 2383.3599999999997 2387.46  Oh, Herman, oh, Herman, we love you so much.
414 2387.46 2390.18  We see your soul behind your eyes.
415 2390.2599999999998 2392.0  We know you had it rough.
416 2392.44 2396.5  Oh, Herman, oh, Herman, we love you so much.
417 2396.8599999999997 2399.44  We see your soul behind your eyes.
418 2399.44 2401.8  We know you had it rough.
419 2402.54 2407.38  What resonates with me with Renee is that she, you see the motto on my shirt,
420 2407.46 2408.5  that's the motto of the shelter.
421 2408.82 2409.7200000000003  Every animal matters.
422 2410.3 2411.08  Every single one.
423 2411.7400000000002 2416.08  And for her, that is this personified.
424 2422.56 2425.66  Look, Houdini's meeting him for the first time.
425 2426.14 2426.5  Aw.
426 2427.36 2428.68  Okay, I'll kiss you.
427 2429.44 2431.2000000000003  He's already trying to convert me.
428 2433.4 2434.66  All right, Renee, I'm going to get out of here.
429 2435.02 2435.94  Thank you for everything.
430 2436.12 2436.48  I appreciate you.
431 2436.48 2436.7400000000002  No problem.
432 2436.94 2437.46  No problem.
433 2437.9 2438.6  So much.
434 2438.68 2440.98  I'll be back out here on Monday to take care of a few little things, okay?
435 2441.12 2441.6  Thank you.
436 2441.66 2441.96  Yes, ma'am.
437 2441.98 2444.9  You know that you wouldn't be doing this project if you weren't going to go vegan.
438 2445.48 2446.7200000000003  So do your research.
439 2447.12 2447.88  You got it.
440 2449.32 2449.94  Bye, girl.
441 2450.28 2450.44  Bye.
442 2450.44 2450.48  Bye.
443 2450.48 2450.98  Bye.
444 2450.98 2451.48  Bye.
445 2451.48 2451.98  Bye.
446 2451.98 2453.7  None of us had any options for this pig.
447 2453.7 2455.36  She was this pig's way out.
448 2455.36 2460.7400000000002  But I just learned that he apparently went into his house this morning at 9.30 when the gates
449 2460.7400000000002 2461.6200000000003  opened here at 10.
450 2461.6600000000003 2462.6800000000003  That's a beautiful story.
451 2462.68 2472.14  If you are here to be part of the show and watch the entertainment and the speakers, the only
452 2472.14 2474.7  way we're going to know you're here is if you're in the front.
453 2475.48 2475.9199999999996  All right?
454 2475.96 2478.08  I know we got vendors out there, and that's important.
455 2478.52 2480.68  But we want to see who's here for a moment.
456 2480.68 2484.22  I know, right?
457 2485.04 2485.8999999999996  No 231?
458 2487.44 2488.04  232?
459 2490.8999999999996 2491.54  233?
460 2494.04 2494.64  234?
461 2495.18 2496.62  You got 234?
462 2496.8599999999997 2498.24  All right, you won.
463 2498.7 2499.66  All right, come on.
464 2504.08 2506.56  97 people showed up to buy tickets.
465 2506.56 2513.04  And with those 97 people, we raised about $8,300.
466 2515.52 2519.54  I had people putting $1,000 in my hand, cash.
467 2520.44 2522.9  I had people putting $100 bills in my hand.
468 2523.7 2527.5  You know, just me walking around, not to mention what happened in the office.
469 2528.34 2530.42  Not to mention what happened afterwards.
470 2530.7 2533.2  I mean, there's just, there was an outpouring.
471 2536.56 2564.82  I'm a surgeon, but I specialize in weight loss.
472 2564.82 2567.26  So I do weight loss surgery and medical weight loss diets.
473 2567.4 2569.06  And I teach people plant-based diets.
474 2569.78 2573.86  The vegan diet works for diabetes, heart disease, cancer.
475 2574.28 2575.2400000000002  What, do I have a bug in my hair?
476 2576.1800000000003 2577.6800000000003  They don't even want to kill bugs, so.
477 2578.98 2583.7000000000003  And it's just been, you know, it's just changed the way I treat people in medicine.
478 2583.94 2585.9  It's my first line of treatment.
479 2586.42 2587.96  Our number one cause of death is heart disease.
480 2588.0800000000004 2589.78  Heart disease is completely preventable.
481 2589.78 2593.46  You do not have to have heart disease, even if you're genetically predisposed to it.
482 2593.78 2597.52  If you eat a plant-based diet, you won't, or especially vegan diet, you're very unlikely
483 2597.52 2599.32  to get a, get heart disease.
484 2599.5400000000004 2603.5800000000004  And same with diabetes, same with certain types of cancer, same with obesity.
485 2603.78 2605.0400000000004  This is all can be cured with diet.
486 2605.04 2612.58  Children are not really attracted to eating meat.
487 2612.68 2615.1  That's something that we kind of push on children.
488 2615.48 2617.1  And we let them choose whatever they want.
489 2617.36 2619.84  And pretty soon they decided they didn't want to eat animals.
490 2620.2599999999998 2624.34  When they figured out, this one was like, isn't it weird that there's a chicken out in
491 2624.34 2625.9  the farm and there's a chicken that you eat?
492 2626.68 2628.4  And it was like, well, no, they're the same thing.
493 2628.46 2629.88  And she was like, they're the same thing.
494 2629.96 2631.7799999999997  And then that was, that was it for eating chicken.
495 2631.78 2645.36  We are an animal farm sanctuary becoming the first ever beef cattle ranch to transition
496 2645.36 2649.0  to a vegan farm sanctuary in the state of Texas.
497 2650.5800000000004 2655.5400000000004  You know, so it doesn't surprise me that we don't have hundreds of people here today, honestly.
498 2656.0800000000004 2658.98  But, but, you know, but it's coming.
499 2659.1600000000003 2660.2000000000003  Oh, you just wait.
500 2660.3 2660.82  It's coming.
501 2660.82 2663.92  And Texas consciousness is waking up.
502 2664.34 2669.2400000000002  And what's really cool is these fine folks, I was talking to Joy the other day and I was
503 2669.2400000000002 2670.36  telling her what we do.
504 2671.2000000000003 2678.04  And she said to me, Renee, you know, we, we have cows here like Texas longhorns.
505 2679.1800000000003 2684.1400000000003  Sometimes the cows, the little babies would go to FFA kids and they fall in love with these
506 2684.1400000000003 2684.6000000000004  cows.
507 2684.6 2692.3199999999997  And if they go to auction, which most of them do, they do get sold and they do go to slaughter.
508 2692.32 2696.7000000000003  So we are going to get to adopt Frosty.
509 2696.7000000000003 2700.7400000000002  And Frosty is going to be our first ever Texas longhorn here.
510 2700.7400000000002 2705.1800000000003  He'll be out here in the pasture with Herman and the rest of the rowdy bunch.
511 2705.18 2716.2799999999997  As she started making a sanctuary, I started reflecting back about my whole life and the way I thought
512 2716.2799999999997 2717.02  about animals.
513 2717.02 2724.28  And I was kind of relieved because now the, if this, I was thinking, wow, if this works,
514 2724.9 2729.68  I can have a bunch of pet cows and I don't have to take them to market.
515 2729.86 2732.34  And Renee would say, they're not pets.
516 2732.54 2733.7599999999998  They are individuals.
517 2733.76 2737.26  And I said, okay, we can have a bunch of individuals.
518 2741.7200000000003 2742.1600000000003  Bullseye.
519 2742.28 2743.0  How you doing, girl?
520 2743.94 2744.5  How you doing?
521 2747.84 2748.86  How you doing, girl?
522 2749.92 2754.5600000000004  I wanted to go to a slaughterhouse and I wanted to see exactly what was happening there.
523 2755.1000000000004 2757.82  And I wanted to do a little bit of filming.
524 2757.82 2766.34  And so I asked a friend of mine, a close physician, friend of mine actually, who I knew his uncle
525 2766.34 2770.6200000000003  was the general manager of a large slaughterhouse.
526 2770.98 2775.86  I asked him just, I thought they would say no, but I asked anyways if there was any possibility
527 2775.86 2776.5800000000004  that I could do that.
528 2777.02 2779.6000000000004  And to my surprise, they said yes.
529 2781.02 2787.1400000000003  Prior to being slaughtered, the animals were so desperately fighting for their lives.
530 2787.14 2793.74  They were so moving around violently and jerking around that when they were supposed to be
531 2793.74 2795.7999999999997  killed, they were really not even killed.
532 2795.92 2798.2599999999998  Many times they were just injured or weakened.
533 2798.94 2804.22  Actually, that's what I saw that happened most of the times with the cows, that they would
534 2804.22 2810.5  hit a captive bolt more so down the neck instead of in the head because probably because of the
535 2810.5 2814.22  reason that it's not easy to hit them in a strategic point with those conditions.
536 2814.22 2822.8399999999997  And so the animals would fall to the ground and they would put a shackle in the hind leg.
537 2822.84 2827.58  And now these animals were still alive.
538 2827.7000000000003 2829.8  The cows were still completely alive.
539 2830.44 2832.7400000000002  And they were even making movements with their hair.
540 2832.78 2837.7200000000003  They weren't as strong to walk out and leave the place, but they were still making movements.
541 2838.26 2841.4  And they were still conscious and their eyes were wide open.
542 2841.4 2849.46  And then the slaughterhouse worker would put the shackle and they would be hanging by their hind leg.
543 2850.36 2857.04  And then a worker would come up to like a platform so that he would be at the same level of the cow.
544 2857.44 2859.2200000000003  And then he would get close to the cow.
545 2859.22 2870.98  And then he would cut off the legs of the cow, like from the knee down, the three legs except for the leg from where she was hanging from.
546 2871.3399999999997 2873.7799999999997  And then the three legs would fall to the floor.
547 2873.78 2880.0600000000004  And then he would come close to her again and lift up the tail of the cow.
548 2880.6800000000003 2884.52  And from the very tip of the tail, he would make a vertical incision.
549 2885.1600000000003 2887.78  I don't know how deep or superficial, but a vertical incision.
550 2888.1000000000004 2889.7000000000003  And then put the object down.
551 2889.7 2902.62  And then he would pull the skin of the cow down so that the cow's own skin was hanging next to her own head on both sides of her head.
552 2903.74 2907.18  And then he would make an incision in her neck.
553 2907.7 2909.6  And then blood would come gushing out.
554 2910.16 2912.1  And she would start choking on her own blood.
555 2912.52 2914.46  And then eventually she would die.
556 2914.46 2920.46  I went to the holding areas.
557 2921.02 2923.9  First of all, I saw that these animals were really, really terrified.
558 2924.64 2930.02  And somehow they all knew what was going on because they would start walking back and being afraid of us.
559 2930.54 2936.02  Even, you know, even in the holding areas because somehow they sensed that something wasn't right.
560 2936.12 2937.14  I think, I think.
561 2937.14 2944.8199999999997  But at the end of the holding areas visit, I saw some of the cows were housed individually.
562 2945.1 2947.3799999999997  Some of them were housed, like, in very large groups.
563 2948.0 2948.68  I'm not sure why.
564 2948.7799999999997 2952.72  But at the end, there was a cow that housed, that was housed individually.
565 2953.3399999999997 2958.7799999999997  This was a huge, beautiful, completely white cow.
566 2958.78 2961.7400000000002  And she was terrified.
567 2962.32 2964.78  Like, you could see that she was really, really anxious.
568 2965.1800000000003 2966.9  She was, she was really afraid.
569 2967.0800000000004 2969.26  I, I have a feeling that somehow they know.
570 2969.34 2974.28  I don't know why they would know, but maybe they can smell the blood because it was right adjacent to the south.
571 2974.38 2976.0400000000004  Maybe they can smell it or I don't know.
572 2976.4 2977.94  But she was really nervous.
573 2978.28 2979.6400000000003  And we were at the end of the visit.
574 2979.64 2984.9  So I asked the guy who was giving me the tour, if you want to call that, or the visit, who was with me.
575 2985.2 2986.98  And I asked him if I could stay there with the cow.
576 2987.06 2988.02  So he stayed with me.
577 2988.3799999999997 2992.1  And we were talking with the cow for about 15 or 20 minutes.
578 2992.24 2992.68  I was.
579 2992.74 2993.62  He was standing there.
580 2994.22 2996.2  But she calmed down.
581 2996.66 2998.54  And I was even petting the cow.
582 2998.98 3000.74  And, and she really calmed down.
583 3000.8599999999997 3003.14  And she was in much better conditions.
584 3003.14 3015.1  But then the next day, when I went to the actual slaughter facility, and when I was filming all of these horrible things that I just told you,
585 3015.6 3018.3199999999997  it came the turn of all of the cows.
586 3018.44 3023.04  It came the turn of that white, beautiful cow to go through slaughter.
587 3023.04 3034.44  And it was so much harder because the fact that this white cow wasn't, she didn't even fight back like the other cows.
588 3034.88 3036.64  She could smell the blood.
589 3037.02 3038.14  She could hear the other cows.
590 3038.22 3039.7  She knew exactly what was going on.
591 3040.0 3047.48  But for some reason, I think she thought that I was going to help her because she came, she even like positioned herself.
592 3047.6 3049.74  Like they didn't have to shove her in too much.
593 3049.74 3058.8199999999997  The, the workers were like shoving the other cows and the other cows were jumping on their, I mean, getting on their hind legs.
594 3059.22 3061.58  They were trying to crawl the wall.
595 3061.8799999999997 3069.7799999999997  And this white cow, she just went straight up to me because I was about, about half a meter away from where their heads were with my camera.
596 3070.24 3072.54  And she walked straight up to me.
597 3073.3399999999997 3075.58  And she was just staring at me.
598 3075.58 3082.46  And the other workers were pushing her and then the door, the metal door closed behind her.
599 3082.46 3086.2200000000003  And even with all of that, she was not fighting back.
600 3086.36 3092.36  All that she was doing was with her eyes wide open, she was standing still and she was staring at me.
601 3092.44 3093.56  She wasn't even blinking.
602 3094.0 3096.44  Like she was begging for me to help her.
603 3096.54 3102.38  Somehow she, she probably sensed that I didn't want to, you know, for this, for this to happen.
604 3102.38 3106.58  And obviously, you know, obviously I didn't want that to happen, obviously.
605 3106.58 3111.58  Um, but it was so hard because she was just imploring for me to help her.
606 3111.96 3114.7400000000002  And there was absolutely nothing that I could do.
607 3114.74 3140.52  Don't give up.
608 3140.52 3144.86  Just got to focus and find some comfort within the discomfort.
609 3144.86 3145.98  Okay.
610 3145.98 3148.56  We're going to work on some lateral movements, speed skaters.
611 3148.56 3149.44  Okay.
612 3149.44 3152.22  We're going to go to the side, alternating legs.
613 3152.22 3153.12  Okay.
614 3153.12 3157.4  In five, four, three, two, one, go.
615 3158.68 3160.04  Get a nice T position.
616 3161.4 3162.84  And hold them out.
617 3163.18 3165.14  Four minutes beginning now.
618 3165.14 3171.3799999999997  And those little voices start coming into your head.
619 3171.3799999999997 3172.44  They tell you to quit.
620 3172.6 3173.48  Tell you to give up.
621 3173.7799999999997 3175.56  Just like in life when it gets tough.
622 3175.68 3176.48  You don't give up.
623 3176.8199999999997 3178.12  You can override that.
624 3178.2599999999998 3180.2599999999998  Push past and come out on the other side.
625 3180.7999999999997 3184.42  We'll be hooking you guys up big time.
626 3186.5 3188.52  One, two, three.
627 3188.52 3194.98  I met Yasin in Ithaca, New York.
628 3194.98 3200.64  Um, this quirky little town where I was on the faculty at Cornell.
629 3200.64 3211.72  And Yasin was living, um, with his brother and sister-in-law, um, kind of in the out, on the outskirts of the city.
630 3211.72 3215.08  And he came to one of my yoga classes.
631 3215.72 3217.7599999999998  Uh, I was teaching yoga at the time.
632 3218.4599999999996 3221.4199999999996  And that was the beginning.
633 3221.56 3223.22  He kept coming back to the classes.
634 3223.22 3225.2  And he was really bad at yoga.
635 3225.2 3228.74  And he would come to the meditation classes as well.
636 3228.8199999999997 3235.12  And he was worse at that because he needed, like, ten props, blankets, pillows.
637 3235.12 3242.12  Um, my teacher spent, like, twenty minutes just getting him comfortable because his body is so tight.
638 3242.12 3247.12  He had long, wavy hair and a ponytail.
639 3247.12 3250.12  And he was kind of bigger than he is now.
640 3250.12 3259.12  And, and I started to think, wow, this guy keeps coming to these classes and he's really bad at it.
641 3259.12 3262.12  I wonder if, um, he likes me.
642 3262.12 3271.12  We went away on a honeymoon to Costa Rica before we got married.
643 3271.12 3275.12  And then right after we got married, we went to the farm sanctuary in upstate New York.
644 3275.12 3277.12  And we stayed overnight there.
645 3277.12 3280.12  And we had an amazing experience connecting with the animals.
646 3280.12 3286.12  I also remember going on a vacation with him to some South American country.
647 3286.12 3290.12  And they asked him, why don't you eat meat?
648 3290.12 3296.12  You know, they didn't ask me, but for the man not to be eating meat in this South American country was really weird.
649 3296.12 3301.12  And so Yassine said, um, because I don't want to hurt animals.
650 3301.12 3305.12  And the waiters laughed at him.
651 3305.12 3319.12  And I thought that that was just so authentic, um, and brave of Yassine to show that empathy to others.
652 3319.12 3326.12  I think it was a big moment for him because it was one of the first times he had been challenged or asked, uh, why?
653 3326.12 3330.12  And he didn't, at that time, didn't say like all the health benefits.
654 3330.12 3334.12  His immediate response was because of the animals.
655 3334.12 3341.12  And that's really representative of the kind of person that he is.
656 3341.12 3349.12  Not only are runners vegan, but they're actually performing at a high level.
657 3349.12 3354.12  I think that is out there on the table now that you do get enough protein.
658 3354.12 3356.12  That's not a question anymore.
659 3356.12 3366.12  Us vegan runners kind of stick together and kind of know of each other and are kind of proud of each other when we do perform on a high level on a big stage.
660 3366.12 3381.12  One thing, uh, I really do enjoy is cooking for vegans and non-vegans in my home and seeing their eyes light up about how good it is and how full they feel.
661 3381.12 3383.12  Because I think a lot of people have a misconception.
662 3383.12 3389.12  They feel like they're not going to get satiated or they're not going to be filled up because they don't have a big hunk of meat to fill their belly.
663 3389.12 3395.12  I love when people come over and they're just like, wow, that was an amazing dish.
664 3395.12 3397.12  Oh, I feel so good.
665 3397.12 3400.12  And it was all plant-based.
666 3400.12 3401.12  Thank you.
667 3401.12 3402.12  Enjoy.
668 3402.12 3404.12  There's other, like other pancakes.
669 3404.12 3407.12  Hey, before we start eating, I want to make a toast.
670 3407.12 3410.12  I really thank you guys for coming over and cheers to everybody.
671 3410.12 3412.12  Good luck this weekend.
672 3412.12 3413.12  You can see.
673 3413.12 3414.12  Absolutely.
674 3414.12 3415.12  Run strong.
675 3416.12 3423.12  After dinner the night before a race, I love to go out for a nice slow shakeout run with my friends.
676 3425.12 3436.12  The first time I met Yassine was a 50 mile race just outside of Seattle called the White River 50 miler.
677 3436.12 3441.12  And I was running along and all of a sudden this guy comes up to me and he starts talking my ear off like, hey, I went vegan.
678 3441.12 3442.12  You know, you really inspired me.
679 3442.12 3444.12  And he was just going nuts.
680 3444.12 3445.12  I'm like, you know, who is this guy?
681 3445.12 3449.12  And at the same time, like, wow, he's really got an energy to him.
682 3449.12 3452.12  And he, I thought, you know, would drop off eventually.
683 3452.12 3457.12  But he just hung with me for the next, like, five miles up this brutal climb.
684 3457.12 3462.12  And, you know, he had as much energy in his voice as he did in his heart and lungs.
685 3462.12 3468.12  Yassine is just one of those charismatic, you know, runners and ultra runners where we're an interesting and odd bunch.
686 3468.12 3472.12  But we also kind of like, you know, we can pick up wherever we left off.
687 3472.12 3477.12  And I think that's, that's the beauty of our sport as well as a vegan diet.
688 3477.12 3483.12  You know, again, we're connected by a certain thread and that is running and being vegan.
689 3483.12 3492.12  So it's always great to come back and just hang out and hang out as buddies and as if nothing, as if no time has really passed.
690 3492.12 3495.12  We're just the same individuals at the core.
691 3495.12 3502.12  So in 1999, I'm lined up for my first Western States 100 mile race, probably the biggest race I was in.
692 3502.12 3507.12  I was competing in my life and I just transitioned to a vegan diet that winter.
693 3507.12 3510.12  And there's still doubts in my head, you know, can this really work for me?
694 3510.12 3515.12  And I was thinking, you know, I probably need to eat some meat here even a week up to the race.
695 3515.12 3520.12  And after I won that race on a plant-based diet, there was no looking back.
696 3520.12 3525.12  I had never doubted myself and went on to win seven consecutive Western States 100 mile races.
697 3525.12 3529.12  Scott Jurek was the pioneer vegan runner.
698 3529.12 3534.12  And now we're starting to hear more and more it being more mainstream.
699 3534.12 3549.12  Last year, Scott, after running the Appalachian Trail, which is over like 2,000 miles across 14 states, covering elevation changes of 500,000 feet, broke the Appalachian Trail record by over three hours.
700 3549.12 3559.12  There are a lot of parallels of, you know, ultramarathoning and becoming vegan.
701 3559.12 3561.12  You don't just jump right into it.
702 3561.12 3575.12  Sometimes you need to, you know, find that community, you need to try it out for, I tell people to try it out for at least a month to give them some time for your body to adapt to a different cuisine, different diet.
703 3575.12 3581.12  Your body's not quite used to it. It takes a few weeks for the human body to adapt to things.
704 3581.12 3591.12  That's usually why they tell people to go to rehabilitation, for example, for 28 days, is so their body can adapt to the new lifestyle.
705 3591.12 3596.12  Oh, you just want your belly rubbed, don't you? You just want your belly rubbed.
706 3596.12 3610.12  There's definitely a correlation between the spiritual practice of non-harming and veganism and the way I'm living today compared to the way I used to live.
707 3610.12 3616.12  The way I used to live was very harmful to myself, to my body, to my loved ones.
708 3616.12 3628.12  Essentially, I'm trying to live a more spiritual life, and for me, that involves trying to cause as little suffering as possible and to try to just do my best.
709 3628.12 3634.12  And this is very much in alignment with how I'm living today and how I want to live.
710 3634.12 3639.12  This idea of eating animal products, nothing more harmful than that shit.
711 3639.12 3646.12  What's more harmful than destroying the planet and taking all the resources and then poisoning yourself?
712 3646.12 3651.12  You know, the first chakra, don't poison yourself, right? Take care of yourself so you can serve the planet.
713 3651.12 3656.12  So the first thing you do is you're poisoning yourself because the way the animal product is being manufactured, for one,
714 3656.12 3663.12  aside from the fact that the plant-based diet is safer and healthier no matter what, but the way they make the animal product,
715 3663.12 3669.12  the way it's born into—talk about suffering, a hundred billion animals made to be born into suffering.
716 3669.12 3681.12  So, yeah, we don't want to cause any harm. So if we really examine ahimsa and its meaning or if we want to be people who practice ahimsa
717 3681.12 3687.12  or cause less harm, the one thing we shouldn't do, I mean the first and most important thing we should do,
718 3687.12 3690.12  is get away from eating animal products.
719 3690.12 3693.12  You can do whatever you want.
720 3693.12 3699.12  You can create any world you want when you're painting, right? Nothing is wrong when you're painting.
721 3702.12 3705.12  See this little vine over here? You can make a monkey anywhere you want.
722 3705.12 3708.12  Genesis, what's your favorite?
723 3708.12 3709.12  A pig.
724 3709.12 3710.12  A pig?
725 3710.12 3711.12  A pig.
726 3711.12 3713.12  So you guys know what abstract art means?
727 3713.12 3714.12  Uh, no.
728 3716.12 3721.12  Art for Animals Sakes mission is to teach art classes with an animal empathy theme.
729 3721.12 3725.12  So we try to instill compassion for animals through art projects.
730 3726.12 3733.12  And the reason why we use art, it gives youth especially a meaningful way of looking at the issues that we're talking about.
731 3733.12 3738.12  So we try to get kids to come to their own conclusions about animals and how they should be treated.
732 3738.12 3746.12  Somebody once famously said if you gave a kid a bunny rabbit and an apple, they're going to eat the apple and play with the bunny rabbit.
733 3746.12 3751.12  You know, so it's just sort of like this thing gets knocked out of us as we get older.
734 3751.12 3760.12  One of the projects that we did was a lantern project and we were basically protesting an animal experimentation lab.
735 3760.12 3762.12  And so we just made these beautiful handmade lanterns.
736 3762.12 3766.12  We had over 280 people from across the United States ship them to us.
737 3766.12 3774.12  And we put them in a public place and people saw these lanterns and they were, they gravitated to it because it was such a beautiful display.
738 3774.12 3775.12  And they said, what is this all about?
739 3775.12 3784.12  And we said, well, actually every one of these lanterns represents one of these animals that is going to be experimented on in this lab that they're going to be building soon.
740 3784.12 3797.12  And so by putting something beautiful in the world and enticing a conversation, I think brings people in instead of revolting them or putting them on the defensive.
741 3797.12 3808.12  With Genesis and her age group, I think they're really benefiting from this age because the information is out there and it's whether they want to recognize it, they want to see it.
742 3808.12 3826.12  And she has become such a good spokesperson because she has a strong feeling, but she also has sort of the background and the education, whether she's gotten it on her own or through her parents, to put it into practice.
743 3826.12 3838.12  And I think that's why she's become such a powerful spokesperson at this age, because people see the innocence, but they also see the maturity and the intellectual maturity.
744 3838.12 3850.12  that she brings to the subject. And it's really hard to, you know, talk to a kid and have them say these things that are so basic and so unfiltered and refute it. You just can't.
745 3850.12 3862.12  He was spending the night one night and he's like, what are we going to eat because you guys are vegan? And we're like, well, what do you like? He said, I like meatball subs. So we said, well, we'll serve you that.
746 3862.12 3867.12  So then I was talking to him about veganism and then my mom made a sandwich.
747 3867.12 3881.12  He ate it and he's like, oh, this is really good. So then after that, he left. And then his mom called back. He's like, Tahir wants to go vegan now. And that was the happiest thought I've ever thought.
748 3881.12 3888.12  David Carter, NFL defensive lineman, 300 pound vegan.
749 3888.12 3894.12  Genesis Butler, quarterback, 75 pound vegan.
750 3894.12 3907.12  I'm going to crush you like a little bug, but I don't crush bugs because I'm vegan.
751 3907.12 3910.12  Got insurance? Means you're going to need it.
752 3910.12 3911.12  Need it.
753 3927.12 3928.12  Tucker.
754 3928.12 3929.12  Doesn't make sense.
755 3933.12 3935.12  Hey, good game, Genesis.
756 3935.12 3936.12  Thanks.
757 3936.12 3938.12  Those were just some of my basic moves.
758 3938.12 3939.12  Next time I'll show you some of my real moves.
759 3939.12 3941.12  You know, you talk a lot of trash.
760 3944.12 3951.12  These boys challenged me to a push-off and my mom sent me in this cute little white sparkly blouse.
761 3951.12 3955.12  And then the boys do like 10 push-ups and they're like, oh, I can't take anymore.
762 3955.12 3958.12  Then I'm like, okay, so I can do more. I did a hundred push-ups.
763 3958.12 3965.12  And then I come home, my shirt's all dirty. It's all like black. And my mom's like, what happened?
764 3965.12 3974.12  I'm like, I did push-ups and I did it on the blacktop. And she's like, next time scoot over to the grass a little bit. And she had to throw it away. It was just...
765 3974.12 3979.12  Oh man, I feel sorry for those boys. That must have been a real shot to their ego, huh?
766 3979.12 3988.12  When I first started going vegan, I met this 72-year-old guy. His name is Victoris Kovinskis. And I was doing like a hundred push-ups and I thought I was doing a lot.
767 3988.12 3999.12  For me, that's what I thought at that time was a lot. But he was doing 200 push-ups at 72 years old in one time. So that was like our little competition. And now I'm doing like 500 push-ups.
768 3999.12 4006.12  So they were messing with you, huh? All the guys thinking that because you were vegan, you couldn't do push-ups and you beat them and you obliterated them.
769 4006.12 4014.12  Yeah, that happened to me. See, everybody was thinking because I was going vegan and I was going to be all weak and small and stuff and never be able to play again.
770 4014.12 4022.12  But I did lose some weight. I got down to 265, but then I put on another 40 pounds of just solid muscle and now I'm stronger than all of them.
771 4022.12 4029.12  So vegan is clearly the best way to go. You know that too. And those little boys that you beat in the push-up contest, they know that too now.
772 4029.12 4037.12  Oh, so another thing your mom told me about was the football game when you showed up in ballerina shoes?
773 4037.12 4045.12  Oh, so I came from a circus protest and we thought it was my brother's game so it was going to be alright.
774 4045.12 4052.12  And he was in his jersey. He was ready. I come, my team's on. They're like, come on, where are you?
775 4052.12 4058.12  And then I had like my save the elephant shirt on. I had everything on, all my protest stuff.
776 4058.12 4064.12  So then they make this 12 alligator rule. It was just like five alligator first.
777 4064.12 4068.12  So now it goes up to 12 because I was pulling flags like that.
778 4068.12 4076.12  I remember when I was playing pop winner. It was the defensive line had to wait five alligators before we could go rush the quarterback.
779 4076.12 4080.12  So they pushed it up because of you to 12 alligators.
780 4080.12 4086.12  Like you were supposed to do for five alligators, one alligator, two alligator, three all the way to five.
781 4086.12 4091.12  So then they pushed it up to 12. So that's like half of the game. The game's almost over.
782 4091.12 4094.12  Genesis, count two more alligators. Fight!
783 4094.12 4099.12  One alligator, two alligator, three alligator, four alligator, five.
784 4099.12 4103.12  So then I do 12 alligators. Go get them!
785 4103.12 4107.12  But I still catch their flags so couldn't do nothing about them.
786 4107.12 4113.12  So they tried to cheat to stop you from sticking, taking their flags and they still ended up looking bad.
787 4113.12 4115.12  There were some big guys too.
788 4115.12 4118.12  Man, how many touchdowns did you score that game?
789 4118.12 4119.12  Five to zero.
790 4119.12 4123.12  Wait, so the score was five to zero. Who scored all the, you scored all the touchdowns?
791 4123.12 4129.12  So you scored, you scored, and this is all boys, right? You're playing against all boys.
792 4129.12 4130.12  I'm not a girl.
793 4130.12 4135.12  All meat eaters and you're the only girl and you're the only vegan and you scored all the touchdowns.
794 4135.12 4141.12  And they had to push the alligators up to 12, from five alligators to 12 alligators.
795 4141.12 4143.12  Just to stop you from snatching all the flags.
796 4143.12 4149.12  Man, shoot, you're doing a better job than me with all this football stuff.
797 4149.12 4151.12  That's right, girl.
798 4151.12 4153.12  horse is throwing away.
799 4159.12 4164.12  P seating in reverse once was that court.
800 4172.12 4178.12  He's beating out much, okay?
801 4178.12 4180.14  We shall overcome
802 4180.14 4181.66  We shall overcome
803 4181.66 4184.26  We shall overcome someday
804 4184.26 4186.099999999999  Oh deep in my heart
805 4186.099999999999 4187.14  I do believe
806 4187.14 4189.0  We shall overcome someday
807 4189.0 4192.0  We'll walk hand in hand
808 4192.0 4193.96  We'll walk hand in hand
809 4193.96 4195.46  We'll walk hand in hand
810 4195.46 4197.82  We'll walk hand in hand someday
811 4197.82 4199.94  Deep in my heart
812 4199.94 4201.36  I do believe
813 4201.36 4203.36  We shall overcome someday
814 4203.36 4205.8  You are not alone
815 4205.8 4207.98  You are not alone
816 4207.98 4210.48  You are not alone today.
817 4211.5599999999995 4215.719999999999  Deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome someday.
818 4216.5 4217.879999999999  We shall overcome.
819 4218.78 4220.179999999999  We shall overcome.
820 4220.9 4223.28  We shall overcome someday.
821 4224.099999999999 4229.459999999999  Deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome someday.
822 4237.98 4242.98  Deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome someday.
823 4242.98 4260.7  I also don't like to use the word typical vegan because I don't know what a typical vegan is anymore.
824 4260.86 4261.959999999999  I don't know if there's such a thing.
825 4261.96 4272.64  I think that sort of 70s version of the tree-hugging, crystal-powered, Birkenstock-wearing unicorn rider is sort of nonsense and has been for a long time.
826 4274.7 4280.76  I left home right after college and I ended up walking, actually, all the way from New England to Tennessee.
827 4281.44 4286.68  And I ended up in Tennessee at a community called The Farm, which at that time was the largest hippie commune in the world.
828 4287.16 4290.64  There was about almost 1,000 people there and they were all vegetarians.
829 4290.64 4292.400000000001  In fact, we would today call them vegans.
830 4292.54 4294.26  No one heard of the word vegan in 1975.
831 4296.58 4298.54  I fought competitively for many, many years.
832 4298.9800000000005 4307.02  I still train and there's nothing more satisfying than getting into the ring with a guy who's 20 years younger than I am and just completely handing him his ass.
833 4309.02 4311.660000000001  Nine years later, I shaved my head.
834 4312.280000000001 4317.900000000001  And for the second time in my life, I found myself in a community that was vegan.
835 4317.9 4321.58  This was Sangwangsa Zen Monastery in South Korea.
836 4321.879999999999 4327.299999999999  And I went there and became a Zen monk with the idea of doing an intensive meditation.
837 4328.259999999999 4336.94  And I realized, though, that these people in this monastery had been living what we would call a vegan way of living for 750 years.
838 4336.94 4341.08  I can remember one of my old coaches who was super traditional.
839 4341.2 4344.879999999999  He was about 1,000 years old, old Chinese guy, who used to say, you've got to be more aggressive.
840 4344.98 4345.759999999999  You've got to eat more meat.
841 4345.86 4347.36  You've got to eat more meat and be more aggressive.
842 4349.04 4352.7  So there was no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no wool, no silk, no leather.
843 4353.0199999999995 4355.219999999999  Even mosquitoes you wouldn't just kill.
844 4355.299999999999 4356.379999999999  You would put them outside.
845 4356.38 4367.12  And then at the same time, he would sit us all down for two-hour meditations and say, walk the middle path and embrace freedom and balance.
846 4367.58 4370.66  Now get in there and kick that guy's ass and bring home a trophy for the school.
847 4372.66 4378.34  The whole idea was that if we want to evolve in consciousness and become more awake,
848 4378.92 4382.9800000000005  then the fundamental, most important thing is kindness to others.
849 4382.98 4390.62  And it's that same sort of cognitive dissonance that says, I can pet my dog and love my golden retriever,
850 4390.719999999999 4392.599999999999  and then I can eat a double bacon cheeseburger.
851 4393.799999999999 4396.0  And it simply never made sense to me.
852 4398.4 4400.0  We are all interconnected.
853 4400.5 4403.5199999999995  The interconnectedness of life is the fundamental spiritual teaching.
854 4403.759999999999 4409.759999999999  And from understanding that more deeply, we liberate ourselves as we liberate others.
855 4409.76 4415.96  We are all on this crazy rock flying through the universe, and we're in it together.
856 4416.280000000001 4418.46  And I know it sounds, again, it sounds a little crystal-powered,
857 4418.84 4422.9800000000005  but it's really the only thing that we know for sure,
858 4423.08 4425.5  which is that we're all adrift in a sea of chaos, you know?
859 4425.56 4428.68  And the mountain is not there, and me and the trees are here.
860 4428.780000000001 4430.14  I am the trees, and I am the mountain.
861 4430.26 4431.42  And we are all on the rock together.
862 4431.42 4434.62  And that is the more sublime change that happens
863 4434.62 4437.64  after one realizes that we can't slaughter and eat our fellow earthlings.
864 4439.58 4443.9  The whole idea of veganism is really a social transformation,
865 4444.2 4445.78  but also a personal transformation,
866 4446.06 4451.06  based on awakening out of the delusion of being a fundamentally separate self
867 4451.06 4453.36  and competing with others to get something,
868 4453.8 4456.86  rather to see that as we bless others, we are blessed.
869 4456.86 4483.94  For Amy's with no cheese, that would be completely vegan?
870 4483.94 4489.4  Yeah, but we also can do, to get four vegan Amy's,
871 4489.5 4491.4  I can do them with vegan cheese.
872 4491.94 4492.5  Oh, okay.
873 4492.58 4493.5  Well, actually, you know what?
874 4493.5199999999995 4495.46  I think I'm fine without the cheese, vegan or not.
875 4495.639999999999 4496.82  But that, wow, that's great.
876 4496.879999999999 4497.5  That's good to know.
877 4497.94 4498.139999999999  Okay.
878 4498.219999999999 4499.5  About four Amy's with no cheese?
879 4499.5599999999995 4500.799999999999  Four Amy's, no cheese.
880 4500.98 4506.139999999999  And then I need two non-dairy chocolate and two non-dairy strawberries.
881 4506.82 4509.879999999999  Back in the day in 1970, when I first became a vegan,
882 4510.2 4511.9  you know, a lot of those veggie meats,
883 4511.9 4514.639999999999  I won't name the brand because they're good people that tried hard.
884 4515.299999999999 4517.42  But, you know, they were, you know,
885 4517.46 4520.66  I'm not sure if that veggie meat was good for your body,
886 4520.759999999999 4522.28  but it certainly wasn't good for your soul.
887 4522.639999999999 4526.219999999999  You know, it was kind of like, well, I'm just going to eat this anyway.
888 4526.339999999999 4530.74  It was kind of the inner monologue whenever you would eat some of that stuff.
889 4530.879999999999 4533.62  But it got so much better over the years.
890 4533.679999999999 4538.099999999999  And now, you know, you can go to any restaurant and they have vegan dishes.
891 4538.1 4540.320000000001  You know, nearly any restaurant has that.
892 4540.5 4541.240000000001  And they're delicious.
893 4541.4400000000005 4545.18  And people realize just because you're a vegan doesn't mean you don't like flavor.
894 4546.04 4547.18  Garlic is just fine.
895 4547.780000000001 4549.4800000000005  You know, cayenne pepper is just fine.
896 4549.860000000001 4550.740000000001  Ginger is wonderful.
897 4551.18 4552.72  You know, put some flavor into it.
898 4552.740000000001 4553.88  And that's what I do when I cook.
899 4553.88 4556.16  I make a number of wonderful dishes.
900 4556.3 4558.76  I have a spicy Thai basil eggplant I make.
901 4558.82 4559.8  I make a wonderful curry.
902 4560.0 4563.42  I have a chicken with peanut sauce with fake chicken, of course.
903 4563.900000000001 4567.34  You know, Trinidad squash, Greek potatoes.
904 4567.54 4570.1  I have all these wonderful dishes filled with flavor that people,
905 4570.36 4572.4400000000005  big meat eaters that come to my house, they love it.
906 4572.900000000001 4575.92  And they begrudgingly go meat free for the day.
907 4576.0 4578.24  But then when it's done, when the meal's done, they go,
908 4578.32 4579.52  you know what, I could do this again.
909 4579.62 4581.24  I may do this a little more often.
910 4581.24 4583.86  It's exciting.
911 4584.46 4590.599999999999  I'm a vegan sitting in a drive-thru ordering a burger and a shake and fries.
912 4592.42 4593.219999999999  Very cool.
913 4595.04 4599.139999999999  I didn't fully understand the green aspects of it back in 1970.
914 4599.599999999999 4601.42  But by the early 90s, I did.
915 4601.54 4606.42  You know, it takes so much more land and water and energy to create a pound of beef
916 4606.42 4608.34  than it does a pound of broccoli or a pound of grain.
917 4608.34 4612.34  So it's the green choice in many ways, land use, energy, water, you name it.
918 4613.0 4614.68  Right now on my truck it says vegan.
919 4615.900000000001 4623.28  I'm really considering rebranding into plant-based because I am finding that that is more accessible
920 4623.28 4623.84  to people.
921 4623.84 4626.3  It's the same thing.
922 4626.360000000001 4627.14  It's the same food.
923 4627.84 4638.46  But unfortunately, I think that over time, vegan has created a whole other layering of meaning,
924 4638.68 4644.02  which sometimes can mean militant and people get defensive like, you know,
925 4644.02 4647.700000000001  oh, you're going to tell me how to live my life or whatever.
926 4647.7 4654.5199999999995  There's no joy in being right about climate change or being a vegan or single-use plastic.
927 4654.679999999999 4657.94  You know, some of these things that we've been talking about for many years.
928 4657.94 4663.4  But I would hope that people would be more open to these points of view now that there's
929 4663.4 4666.42  been a great success rate about a lot of things we've been talking about.
930 4666.42 4673.56  You know, right here in L.A. and in several other cities, solar power is now on a par with,
931 4673.92 4677.18  you know, the traditional grid power of coal and natural gas and all of that.
932 4677.34 4679.4  It's now cost-effective to do solar.
933 4679.9 4682.14  So that's a big game changer.
934 4682.34 4688.1  So now maybe people will be open to these kinds of things and dietary choices that you can make
935 4688.1 4690.82  that will be good for the environment and good for your own health.
936 4690.82 4695.2  When I use the term plant-based, I find people just open up.
937 4695.299999999999 4696.36  You can just, oh, yay.
938 4696.58 4697.7  Yeah, I love plants.
939 4697.84 4699.0199999999995  That's good, you know.
940 4699.5199999999995 4705.0  And when I use the term vegan, oftentimes, I just see them kind of close up.
941 4705.16 4708.34  So it's, hey, you know, I want to use what works.
942 4708.74 4715.04  I mean, if people are going to be more open to the word plant-based or words plant-based
943 4715.04 4718.54  as opposed to the word vegan, sure, I'll do it.
944 4718.719999999999 4719.74  As long as I eat my food.
945 4719.82 4720.66  That's all I care about.
946 4720.82 4721.86  I don't care how they get there.
947 4722.219999999999 4726.42  I just want them to get there and then understand what it's about.
948 4726.42 4731.86  And then the discussion about veganism can hopefully come into play.
949 4731.98 4733.0199999999995  I mean, baby steps, right?
950 4734.34 4735.259999999999  Whatever works.
951 4736.719999999999 4742.16  What do we do as activists that actually reaches people and that actually changes the world?
952 4742.78 4744.36  You know, screaming is fun.
953 4745.16 4750.7  Throwing fake blood is really satisfying, but it doesn't change the world.
954 4750.82 4752.54  It doesn't make the world a better place for animals.
955 4752.54 4756.42  It just satisfies our emotional need to scream and throw fake blood.
956 4756.42 4768.18  You know, so in being a vegan activist and being an animal rights activist, the criteria by which my actions are judged is how effective am I at being an activist for animals?
957 4768.18 4770.22  You know, not how much I enjoy it.
958 4770.22 4773.780000000001  Not how much I want to scream, because I just want to scream at everybody.
959 4773.78 4778.16  But am I making the world a better place through my activism for the animals?
960 4778.16 4783.74  My grandfather's a butcher.
961 4784.26 4785.099999999999  Grew up in Kansas.
962 4786.42 4789.26  You know, meat-eating, meat-eating, meat-eating family.
963 4789.26 4796.14  And here it was almost in the middle of the night, and I hear this wailing coming from the barn.
964 4796.52 4802.42  It's pouring down rain and whatever, so I put on my big old rubber boots and go on down there.
965 4803.360000000001 4808.4800000000005  And storms happening outside, and it's cold, and it's dark, and it's...
966 4808.48 4813.98  It was an experience like you can't imagine, unless you live through it, I think.
967 4814.08 4818.919999999999  You know, I mean, I've birthed my own babies, but I'm a little distracted.
968 4819.379999999999 4826.36  But here, I'm watching the miracle of life just happen right in front of me, and my hands are right there, and I'm in there,
969 4826.36 4837.04  and I'm actually inside this lamb pulling out the baby, and it was just a really beautiful moment.
970 4838.48 4868.459999999999  It's just a really beautiful moment.
971 4868.46 4873.24  I feel a connection like I would with a child of my own.
972 4876.9 4891.12  You know, it changed me in my thoughts about food, especially to the day that she was killed.
973 4891.12 4895.7  I wasn't home by design.
974 4896.08 4897.2  I knew she was going to be.
975 4898.26 4900.44  That was the plan from the beginning.
976 4900.599999999999 4901.92  That was our structure.
977 4902.2 4903.12  That's what we did.
978 4903.12 4909.08  And so, you know, it was tough that day.
979 4910.68 4918.38  But my background has always been, you know, this is life.
980 4918.5599999999995 4920.9  This is the way things are.
981 4921.14 4922.44  And this is...
982 4922.44 4924.28  So my feelings were wrong.
983 4924.28 4926.96  You know, I needed to bucket up.
984 4927.179999999999 4936.94  I needed to get with the program and stop being so emotional about it and feed my family.
985 4937.5 4940.0  And that was kind of the attitude of things.
986 4940.0 4955.9  And so I cooked dinner a short time later using this baby and cried for days.
987 4955.9 4957.9  It was...
988 4957.9 4958.9  It was...
989 4958.9 4959.9  It was...
990 4959.9 4960.9  It...
991 4960.9 4961.9  It was...
992 4961.9 4962.9  It was...
993 4962.9 4965.179999999999  It was...
994 4965.179999999999 4966.599999999999  It was...
995 4966.599999999999 4966.9  It was...
996 4966.9 4968.62  It was...
997 4968.62 4969.9  It was...
998 4974.28 4975.0199999999995  It was...
999 4975.0199999999995 4983.379999999999  I'm resonating to the sound of the Spirit in the forest and the stream.
1000 4983.38 4990.38  Vibrating to eternal rhythms
1001 4990.38 4996.5  Where the mysteries unfold magically
1002 4996.5 5001.68  Every year for Thanksgiving we do a celebration for the turkeys
1003 5001.68 5004.0  Where the turkeys are the guests of honor
1004 5004.0 5006.82  The turkeys dig in, they love pumpkin pie
1005 5006.82 5010.34  And they stick their face right into it
1006 5010.34 5012.28  And splatter it all around
1007 5012.28 5018.04  There's a memory of another space and time
1008 5018.04 5024.24  I'm on my way to soaring into the light
1009 5024.24 5027.44  She said, Mom, I got the pig, I got the pig
1010 5027.44 5028.38  Oh, good, good
1011 5028.38 5031.12  And she says, and I named it Herman
1012 5031.12 5032.2  I said, oh, you did not
1013 5032.2 5034.08  After your dad
1014 5034.08 5036.08  She said, I did too
1015 5036.08 5038.28  I said, what's your pig?
1016 5038.28 5042.24  Grace your heart, go forth
1017 5042.24 5044.04  Share the mystery
1018 5044.04 5048.8  The world's ready now for you
1019 5048.8 5051.8  To do what you're here to do
1020 5051.8 5055.7  The planetary signs are in line
1021 5055.7 5058.0  Girl, you're right on time
1022 5058.0 5061.58  Some children want to go vegan
1023 5061.58 5064.2  But the mom and dad don't have enough courage to do it
1024 5064.2 5066.84  So I'm very, very blessed and lucky to have them
1025 5066.84 5071.86  And I think these are the best parents that a child can ask for
1026 5071.86 5077.62  There's a memory of another space and time
1027 5077.62 5085.62  I'm on my way to soaring into the light
1028 5085.62 5091.58  I'm resonating to the sound
1029 5091.58 5095.58  To the sound
1030 5095.58 5099.58  To the sound
1031 5099.58 5106.58  To the sound
1032 5106.58 5136.54  The cage of chickens fell off a tree
1033 5136.54 5141.74  transport into Memorial Park and broke open and all of them but one were killed.
1034 5143.5 5147.58  One of them had one of her wings ripped off and was lying there mostly dead.
1035 5155.26 5161.42  So I went and picked this chicken up and took her to the shelter, took her to our vets, took her to
1036 5161.42 5166.9400000000005  an avian vet and she, we fostered her. We named her Isabelle and got to know her.
1037 5169.5 5175.58  It became impossible to ignore that we had to take the next step and my partner and I had both had
1038 5175.58 5182.06  brushes with being vegan. We've been vegetarian for years but this for us, Isabelle's face was on it.
1039 5182.06 5184.54  To the sound
1040 5184.54 5195.42  This isn't a question about eggs, this is a question about Isabelle and that's a really easy answer.
1041 5195.42 5201.42  Aum Namah Shivaya
1042 5214.54 5228.3  сторон
1043 5231.5 5235.5 
1044 5235.5 5253.74  Could you look an animal in its face and simply say to it that your appetite is more important
1045 5253.74 5254.74  than its suffering?
1046 5254.74 5262.26  You know, that your desire to eat it is more important than its desire to be alive?
1047 5262.26 5268.8  Houdini has fallen in love with Herman the Pig.
1048 5268.8 5269.8  Oh yeah.
1049 5269.8 5275.58  I was out there earlier, nobody else was around and they were just nose to nose.
1050 5275.58 5281.320000000001  And I watched them a little while and they just, I don't know what they were saying to
1051 5281.320000000001 5284.38  each other, but they were communicating.
1052 5292.26 5306.6  Haha.
1053 5306.6 5331.68  To have the experience of somebody that gets dragged to my truck by somebody else generally
1054 5331.68 5337.92  that understands and then they try it and it's just so cool and then they always come to the window.
1055 5337.92 5342.92  That's why we have the best customers because they're always coming to the window after they eat
1056 5342.92 5346.56  saying thank you for being here, it was so good and things like that.
1057 5346.56 5349.92  They're just very generous people, you know, it's nice.
1058 5361.68 5367.66  Your question.
1059 5367.66 5371.4400000000005  Let's leave your intact so that you can get the most valuable information
1060 5371.4400000000005 5375.740000000001  over there.
1061 5375.740000000001 5387.34  Let's leave your inside.
1062 5387.34 5415.14  I'm 65 years of age and I ride my bike all over LA still.
1063 5415.14 5419.64  I'm in great shape and I've been to my high school reunion and I can tell you it's better
1064 5419.64 5420.54  to be a vegan.
